This means that the story follows the actions and resolution of the main character only, and focuses on the character's change of fortune froom good to bad. Another element most crucial to a tragedy is that the plot must incite both fear and pity for all who watch the play. If the play ends with a ""feel good"" moment, then it has failed as a tragedy, as it doesn't incite fear and pity. The purpose of tragedy is not to  satisfy some moral sense, but to inspire feelings appropriate to witnessing a tragedy, to experience a ""cleansing"" of watching someone else suffer.  Lastly, an ideal tragedy must have a protagonist that is not overly righteous or holy, but is not depraved; the character is somewhat middle of the road.  By having the character behave in this way it makes the story more realistic and true, making the character's journey that much more engaging for the audience.  When the audience sees a tragic event occur to a plausible character because of a mistake or slight misfortune, the feeling of tragedy is heightened because it seems more true.",3.34823182563613,3.51775345440415

Soldiers were also the ones who supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces. The people who were next after soilders were scribes. A scribe recorded in writing the everyday life and extraordinary happenings in ancient Egypt. Their jobs were varied and included writing letters for fellow villagers who couldn't write, recording the amount of crops harvested. After the scribes came the merchants. Egyptian merchants carried products such as gold, papyrus made into writing paper or twisted into rope, linen cloth, and jewelry to other countries. Next after merchants were artisans. Artisans created the fine artwork that often covered temples, royal tombs, and other monuments. They worked in large groups to complete engravings, paintings, and hieroglyphics. Despite artisans' skill and creativity, the upper classes often viewed them as little more than common laborers. Next after artisans were farmers. Now we're on to the lower part of the pyrimad with farmers. Farmers are the ones who harvest food. They also harvest papyrus for others(most likely scribes) to write on. Now we're on the VERY bottom of the social pyrimad with slaves and servants. The servants worked as cooks, butlers, litter carriers, and as pharaoh's dressers. The male servants also worked on royal building projects or were sent to fight in the Egyptian army. Egyptian servants did not have many rights but were usually not treated poorly. Egyptian servants could not own or inherit land. Slaves were very important in ancient Egypt as a big part of the labor force, but they were also used for many other purposes.

[...] After only three days, the experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in. The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees"" (CommonLit). This cluster of text qoutes shows how legitamately the student took directions because the students did not even hesitate to follow orders nor did they question the ethics of some of the rules. For example, not a single student questioned the morals of the salute when it was purposefully intended to resemble that of the Nazi regime's salute. This not only proves how naive minor's can be to their superiors but also demonstrates how quickly society can follow one another when the majority is commiting said action. This is the classic case that everyone and their neighboor's mom told you as a kid: ""If your friend jumped off a bridge would you jump too?""- in this case and many, yes, you would be more likely to commit an action, even if it may be questionable, if your peers are also participating in the action.

For example, Romeo and Juliet create a situation in which they both end up killing themselves over the death of the other. In Greek tragedies, the characters must live with their mistakes and suffer, while in Shakespearian tragedies, the characters die.

Aritsotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is ""the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to befall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty..."" (Aristotle 3). This means that in order to have a good tradegy, one must have a main character make a costly mistake that causes them great hardship. The last element of a good tragedy is the avoidance of the utter downfall of a villain, because, according to Aristotle, ""...it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (2). And as stated earlier, pity and fear are one of the most necessary components to an ideal tragedy, so if villian dies a horrible death, the story won't have the necessary components.

1b82ce4967e9,39c16e,"One of the elements Aristotle claims is crucial to constructing an ideal tragedy is the emphasis on building a story out of pity and misfortune. As stated in paragraph 2, Aristotle remarks that "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" Aristotle is explaining how the best method of displaying tragedy in any poem is to put the main characters in a constant state of misfortune, which is meant to drive forward the narritive as it progresses. Next, Artistotle exclaims that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered ""good or bad"", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty"". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be relatable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil pasts. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, "" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible."" This describes how building narratives based around icons of tragedies enhances the feelings of pity and misfortune when the main characters experince the tragedies themselves.",3.80272207089915,3.51483103434524

1ec6c7f88443,39c16e,"           Aristotle believes there are certain elements that come together to produce an ideal tragedy. He believes the character who commits the tragic flaw should be a fair character who is well known, and should be not a great nor terrible person. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, Romeo isn't a villian or an amazing person, but rather a typical teenage boy more than anything else.  In addition, Aristotle believes the tragic flaw should not occur due to immoral behavior by the character, but rather by an error or a mistake. For example, Romeo's tragic flaw came through his impulsive decision to marry Juliet, which wasn't a terrible, immoral act. Lastly, the plot of a tragedy should consist of a good to bad change of fortune. In the beginning of the tragedy, the character should experience something good, but his/her's fortune should turn to something bad towards the end. Overall, the ideas of a neither good nor bad character, an underserving misfortune, and a flow of a good to bad fortune are three of Aristotle's many elements of an ideal tragedy.

For example, if meat is discovered to be sour after being taken from the pickle, it is rubbed with soda to take the smell away. Chemistry was also practiced to choose the color, flavor, and odor of the ruined meat (paragraph 2). This meant that to successfully cover up the unsanitary meat sold to the public, chemistry was practiced to make it look healthy. In addition, chemical combinations, such as borax and glycerin, were added to spoiled meat and dumped back into the hopper to be sold to the public (paragraph 3). They were able to not only preserve the moldy meat with borax, but also mixed it in with fresh meats to cover up the taste or smell of spoiled meat.

237657cb7563,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, one element of an ideal tragedy is that it should incite feelings of pity and fear within us. Aristotle believes that a good tragedy doesn't just show for the spectacle, but truly makes us feel for the characters, and incites those feelings of pity and fear.  As Aristotle states, ""It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear."" Aristotle also believes that another element of the ideal tragedy does not feature a turn from bad to good, but instead should feature the reverse and should go from good to bad. He believes that this turn should be brought about by a crucial mistake made by a character. The third element of an ideal tragedy is one with a single issue as its plot. Aristotle compares those with a ""double threat of plot"", like the Odyssey, as second rank. He believes that it is only considered the best because of the weakness of the audience. A true poet doesn't write just based on the wishes of the audience and because of that misses the true tragic pleasure of an ideal tragedy.",2.22056771283714,1.75612953239332

25e459261b79,39c16e,"Aristotle was one the smartest philosopher's at this time and had many opinions on how a tragedy should be written. Firstly,  Aristotle believed that a plot should be complicated rather than simple. The text states ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" (Aristotle). This quote shows how he believes a complicated plot is a necessity for tragedy. Aristotle  also believed that a tragedy should cause pity and fear in the audience. in paragraph 2, the text states, "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle). This once again brings up the topic of catharsis otherwise known as emotional release. Aristotle believes that a true tragedy should make the audience feel pity and frightened and be able to release these emotions because of the show. Aristotle also believed that the characters should be relatable to invoke this fear into the people. The text states, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity"" (Aristotle). This explains how a charcter that is morally grey, as most humans are, will be more relatable and make the audience feel pity. They will also be scared, because they do not want this to happen to themselves. Lastly,  Aristotle believes that these plays should end tragically or else it is second tiered.  The article states "" The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Orestes and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain"" (Aristotle). In this he is explaining that without the unhappy ending, it doesnt not give the audience 'true tragic pleasure'.

32f23f665431,39c16e,"According to this reading, Aristotle views the concept of an ideal tragedy by using elements of six different parts, but the most important according to him, are elements of plot, character, and thought. First, the element of the plot for an ideal strategy is meant to be the soul of the overall tragedy as a whole, and its main responsibility to keep every other factor that is part of a tragedy together. Aristotle believes that the plot should always be provided a beginning, middle, and end, in a proper way.  ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle's belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character's morals. ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.""(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. ""yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone's poor sense of judgement or by fate.

Another element Artistole believes is in an ideal tragedy is, ""the downfall of the utter villian be exhibited"" (Artistole, 2). Connecting this to Hamlet, this means that if Claudius is the villian, he shouldn't die because it would cause the audience to think of it as misfourtune. Finally, the third ideal trait that a true tragedy should posess is, ""some great error or frailty, in a chracter"" (Artistole, 3).

3971e6ab3679,39c16e,"    3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle includes a well-contructed plot, a tragedy arranged on a complex plan, and it needs to bring emotion from readers. Primarily, Aristotle discusses about the importance of constructing a plot that goes from good to bad. Having a good to bad plot will lead to an ""end unhappily. It is... the right ending."" If this plot is able to work, the most tragic effect will be the outcome because it satifies ""the moral sense, [and' inspires pity or fear."" Moreover, an ideal tragedy needs to build emotions from readers. The perfect tragedy must ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" which is achieved by a change of fortune from good to bad. Aristotle makes it clear that emotions are able to occur when ""some great error or frailty"" happens that changes the character from descriptions mentioned before which makes a character go from good to bad. Lastly, a tragedy should be built on a complex plan. For a complex plan, the audience should feel pity for a character which would later be used against the audience. Trying to reverse the effects of making the audience feel pity to fear is key for a perfect tragedy as ""it is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators."" Poets need to take audiences by surprise because it's similar to killing off the main character of a movie, for it would bring in tons of emotion and catch the audience off guard of something they would never expect to happen. All in all, Aristotle tries to convey his point of how to create a perfect tragedy and demonstrates how thoughtful and impactful a tragedy could be. However, Aristotle wants to make it more known that a short story can be constructed in an emotionally compelling way part of which still applies even in modern times.",3.00564245659694,3.22629229077931

Along with this, they would label the packages in many ways to make it look like it was ""original"" even if they were made out of meat parts that were not supposed to be used. Another form in which they would use and cover-up spoiled meat would be by getting spoiled whole ham and old sausage with mold from Europe and dosing it with borax and glycerin, where it would then be dumped into hoppers and made over again for packaging. Mice, feces, poisoned bread, dirt, diseases, and sawdust were just a few things that would be processed in the hoppers along with the spoiled meat. Lastly, they would also use their chemistry department to make sausages appear brown-with the use of borax and colored gelatin- and labeled it ""smoked"" sausage after their practice of smoking sausage became expensive for the factory.  In all, the actions in which the factory practiced were extremely unsanitary and do not appear today thanks to the Meat Inspection Act. ",3.50322573269907,3.63812632907257

Another element he seems to jest to is that of it being relatable and in that same sense, it must be likeable, as a character that we don't relate to or like will not grasp out of the audience the proper reaction that is sought out.

Aristotle wrote, ""it should moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). He not only states that it should create the feeling of pity and fear, but also states that these two feelings are distinctive marks of tragedies. This helps to explain why he stresses how the story should change, ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (3). Tragedies are supposed to be sad and make the reader feel bad for the character which a story from good to bad does, while a story from bad to good  expresses the feeling of achievement and reshapes for the better. Lastly he describes the element of how misfortune is not brought by, ""Vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty""(2). He said the character can't be a villain because this wouldn't be a tragedy and the person couldn't be someone known for being good. It must be a renowned and prosperous person whose misfortune happens because he makes a wrong judgment or bad choice instead of something they have always done like a habit.

574369ff8f20,39c16e,"An ideal tragedy must have a relateable hero, a singular plot, and a plot where the hero's own human flaws cause their demise. This is exemplified by Aristotle's description of the ideal tragic hero. Paragraph 2 states, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" It's imperative to understand that the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and their qualities are some of the defining traits of a tragedy. The protagonist has to speak to a common humanity within the audience in order to have maximum emotional appeal and impact.  The audience will only be distressed at the events the hero is subject to if they can cry with him and relate  to them just like any person. If the protagonist is either someone incredibly saint-like that never makes mistakes that result in conflict or outrageously and comedically evil that succeeds because of their malevolence, the audience will not be able to see themselves in the hero because such drastic personalities or situations rarely happen in real life. Because the fundamental plot elements seem fantastical, the audiene will feel more removed from the play and will not feel the pain as the hero feels it when they fail, or the triumphance when they succeed. The best way to make a hero human to the audience is to give them nuance. Like most people, the tragic hero should generally strive to do good but get caught up by their own mistakes like pride, anger, lack of judgement, etc. so that they aren't bad people but still accountable for their mistakes. It's essential to make tragic heroes essentially common men that the audience already identifies with (such as honorable nobility who are still humans without any special or divine powers) who have relateable motivations and qualities that cause them to fail due to their own actions while still being sympathetic people. Since this reminds the audience of themselves, it will feel all the more tragic when they suffer, which is the point of the tragic play. In order to have the optimal amount of misery, the plot should be singular. This is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4, which state, ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families. ...In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. ...It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Orestes and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This text demonstrates how one single serious plot is necessary for a proper tragic play. A true tragedy must have the complex protagonist endure general failure as well as the associated physical and emotional pain due to their own incorrect actions, and this should be the only plot point in the play to prevent distractions. On the other hand, double plots  often resolve positively without events like major character death or conflict. The idea that the protagonist does not have to endure any of the consequences of their actions and suffer as a result is the complete antithesis of a tragedy. As a result, the audience does not reach catharsis because there are no emotional stakes if everything is fixed by the end. Therefore, they have no lasting negative emotions pertaining to the play.",3.36999122260667,3.89794064266612

57d4aad66e97,39c16e,"    The ideal tragedy should include a multi-dimensional conflict, a neutral character's mistake, and that character's fortune turning from good to bad. A conflict that only has one tragic trait is not a tragedy, since it will not have enough dimension to provoke the emotions within an audience that are associated with tragedy, since this kind of conflict ""never satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear"" due to its basic nature (""On Tragedy""). Therefore, the writer(s)  should include multiple traits that build up to form the many different pillars that make a tragedy, since tragedies rarely occur because of a single tragic trait. To follow this conflict outline, the main character in a tragedy should be neither good nor bad, and their misfortune should occur due to a mistake that they've made. This is because ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" meaning that it will be easier for the audience to feel pity and empathize with a character if they can see themselves in that character's shoes (""On Tragedy""). The character's fortune should also change from good to bad, since this will reflect the same pity in the audience that was aforementioned. When it comes down to why the target feeling is pity, that's because pity is the leading feeling that audiences have when reacting to tragedies. After all, tragedies are defined as ""great suffering, destruction, and distress,"" and these types of situations always have emotional consequences (Oxford Dictionary).

These various ways in which the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat are all discussed in the second paragraph of the excerpt from The Jungle. ",1.70728697858944,1.38158740913282

This is due to the fact that people believe that the Pharohs were the human versions of the gods. The Pharohs held the most responsiblility and were the most powerful. They were also buried within stone pyramids. Beneath the Pharohs lies the Nobles, who essentially were the government. To quote from the text, they ""profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh."" Oh yeah, and the Preists (also up here with the Nobles) had the job of making sure that the gods were happy, and didn't hypothetically cause the destruction of humanity,  but THAT DOESN'T MATTER. Anyways, next is the middle class. the middle class, of course, was in the middle.  It contained craftsmen(men refering to both men and women, plus the possible addition of nonbinary peeps if the term hypothetically existed at the time) and shopkeepers. But what did they make? What did they sell? Well what do YOU think??

Well, not at the bottom, but.. Let's just say that in the egyptian society, you're either at the top, or at the bottom. And, despite the existence of the middle class, THERE IS NO INBETWEEN.

66db2c282419,39c16e," Three elements of an ideal tragedy that are described by Aristotle are plot, character, and diction. Plot should give a single issue and not double and should be from good to bad in terms of change of fortune. The fortune should come as a result of error in a character from better to worse and imitate pity and fear. Character should be defiant of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity from the spirit of Tragedy and possess no tragic qualities and related to the audience to create emotions. Diction or choice of words should be arranged in a simple, but complex plan and imitate actions of pity and fear, while also thoroughly satisifing moral sense and well-being. Evidence to support these statements are in paragraphs 2 and 3 where it reads, "" A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves...A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse... the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty...A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" These pieces of evidence further support my assertion of the three main elements of an ideal tragedy being plot, character, and diction by showing the importance of a plot and its significance of portraying pity and fear and character and its importance of showing one's personality to be from adversity to prosperity, while showing the significance of diction and its well-being of providing a sense of pity and fear and satisying moral sense throughout the play and tragedy in its choice of words.",1.98471716382454,2.54906922938127

686d9ba7cdf6,39c16e,"   An ideal tragedy follows a relatable protagnist. This character is flawed and down to earth in order for the audience to truly empathize with the hero's fatal flaw and sympathize with their great downfall. The plot of the story should follow the hero's fall from grace as a result of their behavior and the advancement of a heinous villain. The protagonist begins the story with good luck, then ends it with bad luck (and vice versa, in the antagonist's case). The most vital aspect of a tragedy is its ending. Tragedies must end unhappily. The hero must suffer a horrible ending and the villain is encouraged to prosper (or at least to win). This is to arouse deep seated feelings of fear and pity in the audience, feelings that they are usually disconnected with and tragedies were created to help the audience regulate their (often repressed) negativity by connecting with and learning from the protagonist's fate.

By the third day, the movement had tons of students involved all of whom showed, ""a drastic improvment in academic skills and tremendous motivation"" (CommonLit Staff). All members were issued a member card and given a specific task/assignment to honor the movement. As members started to learn how to recruit more people, membership increased to over 200 students. They asked questions in three words or less and prefaced all their statments with ""Mr.Jones"". By the experiment's fourth day, Jones saw an alarming amount of loyalty and dedication to the movement. So much, that he knew he had to shut it down, before it got out of control. To reveal that the whole movement had been an experiment, Jones convinced his students that a presidential candidate of the nationally-recognized movement was publicly announcing it's existence on T.V., and ordered them all to a noon rally on Friday. When the students got to the rally, all they saw was a blank screen. Jones revealed that they had been part of an experiment to show how quickly people will join a group to prove their superiorety over others or have a sense of community no matter the type of community. He also explained how people will excuse any actions as contribution to the movement or classify it for ""the name of the state's honor"" (CommonLit Staff).

7d881c44e9e7,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, the first element of an ideal tragedy is that it should have a complex storyline that evokes emotion in the audience. In paragraph 2, he states, ""...imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man...""  Here he states that the tragedy should show complex characters with a complex storyline so the audience can feel different emotions that should be felt in a tragedy, such as pity and fear. The second element of a tragedy is that the plot should contain a man neither good nor evil whose life falls apart from a mistake. A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa. For example, in paragraph 2, Aristotle states, ""...here remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous..."" Throughout the paragraph Aristotle shows that a character should fall in between good and evil, which in turn can evoke more emotion in the audience rather than merely being shocked. The third element of a tragedy is that the complex storyline and plot should have the character's fortune go from good to bad, because of a greater mistake created. Aristotle continues to mention this throughout paragraph 3 as the ending should always be in misfortune or unhappiness. This is truly defined as a tragedy because of  how these types of common endings surprise the audience as it might be something unexpected.",3.01364175566808,1.71031273290816

This would create more meat and it would get rid of the rats therefore it was seen as a good thing to do. meat that was spoiled would be mixed in with good meat and covered with chemicals in order to prevent awareness of the fact that it was really bad meat. Another form of covering up rotten meat would be taking out the bone where the rotten part was found and inserting a white-hot iron. this would erase the visible trace of rotten and or spoiled meat.

This explains how they would put spoiled meat with fresh meat, instead of throwing the spoiled meat out. If the factory didn't put the spoiled meat in sausage, they would rub it with soda to take away the small, or they would use chemicals to enhance aspects of the meat. From paragraph two it states, ""...how the meat that was taken our of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" This explains there use of soda and chemicals to mask the spoiled meat. Next up, the factory would stuff ham with the spoiled meat using a machine and a needle. The text explains in paragraph two, ""... a cachine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled..."" This evidence further describes how they would mask spoiled meat. Finally, once the factory discovered how to take the bone out of a ham, they would insert a white-hot iron, and they would go on to sell ""boneless hams"" or ""California hams"" and fancy ""skinned hams"" which all were filled with spoiled meat. However no one would buy skinned hams, until they were cooked, and chopped up fine, which they then called ""head cheese"". Evidence comes from paragraph two, ""...but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled “head cheese!” These lines of text explain the procedure that happened to the hams just for them to be sold.

The plot itself should not simply tell the series of events that occur in the story. Rather, it should focus on how the story can be presented in a way to evoke emotions from the audience, such as pity and fear. The characters in a tragedy should also not start from a spot of despair and work towards success. While a basic development from fortune to adversity would also not be ideal for a tragedy, adding more complexity to this story and including aspects that encourage fear or pity would contribute to developing an ideal tragedy. The construction of how the characters reach their final downfall is also a significant element of an ideal tragedy. For instance, not only should a character have a level of relatability to them, but they should also meet their downfall in a unfortunate and undeserving manner.

888abfac4dc6,39c16e,"As described by Aristotle, one element of an ideal tragedy is one that effectively voices it plot through a single lense from which is complex and venturing out into different perspectives instead of and rather than being clear and concise and simplistic to a certain degree. This is supported within the passage in paragraph 2 where it states, ""A perfect tragedy should...be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This quote by Aristotle is comprehending the purpose of the passage to build up the ideal tragedy, and to make the experience for the audience more interesting and worth-while to bring about analogies and comparison on the greatness of tragedies, in general. Another element of an ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, is the use of pity and fear through imitation of certain actions from which  is a persuasive technique used to bring in the audience for more and feel compassion for the main character being affected at hand. Evidence from the text to support this statement is near the beginning of paragraph 2 where it states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" From this expression by Aristotle, we can sense the urgence of pity and fear to the makeup of a tragedy and from which, in line, feeds into the different objectives of a tragedy and what makes a tragedy ideal to Greek playwrights. Last, but not least, the third element of an ideal tragedy mentioned is to have a tragedy that is of a single reference and reasoning from which is the result of misassumed and misfortunate actions rather than of actual bad influence and illicit actions, as seen within paragraph 3 where it states, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double...[i]t should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty.""",3.02165289861063,2.37902381901034

This will be effective in creating feelings of pity and fear for the reader which are two important moods that should result from a tragedy. Another element of an ideal tragedy that Aristotle described is that the tragic hero should be someone well-known and successful. Aristotle uses the examples of Oedipus and Thyestes because both are of royal descent, helping to once again get across the feeling of fear by showing the reader that someone so fortunate may not always be so lucky. Finally, a feature that Aristotle mentioned that should be included in order to create an ideal tragedy would be that the character’s fortune should go from good to bad as opposed to it going from bad to good.

To solve this problem, they decided to extract the bone and insert a white-hot iron, getting rid of all but Number One Grade. To be able to keep selling to the general public, the packers made up numerous schemes and ""they had what they called 'boneless hams,' which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and 'California hams,' which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy 'skinned hams,' which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no  one would buy them--that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled 'head cheese!'""

He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families.""

He states this throughout paragraph two when he says ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" In paragraph three, Aristotle begins to discuss the importance of plot. Aristotle states that the plot of a play should not be simple but not overly complex. He states this when he says ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain."" He then goes on to say that throughout the plot, the change of fortune should go from good to bad. In the last paragraph, Aristotle discusses true tragic endings and how some well know plays are mistaken for tragedies. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy has a complex plot. He states this in the quote ""In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. "" He then moves on to say that these types of tragedies do not have true tragic ends. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy ""is proper rather to Comedy"" and ends with ""those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies....quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain.""

8d9cd2ec20cb,39c16e,"Three elements of an ideal tragedy as described by Aristotle are a well constructed plot, a character's soul, as well as the production/performance. The most important element of an ideal tragedy is based off of the plot. Aristotle says that, "" The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,"" (Aristotle, 3). The outcome of the main character will have come from some sort of great error or frailty, the ideal tragic hero should be an all good man with a very minor flaw in his character, and the entire tragedy should be continued upon this judgement. Aristotle also explains how a the plot should be a very complex plan where the actions of the characters exemplify emotions such as pity and fear with the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. He suggests that the best sorts of a tragedy are the complex plots that arouse both pity and fear. He then explains how a good plot must avoid a hero becomming miserable, avoid the transition from misery to happiness for an the antagonist, and also avoid the antagonist to feel happiness and leading into one's misery. He simply just believes that the best plot derives from the mistrtune of someone and whose future downfall leads to an error in judgement. The second element includes the character's actions and personality. To Aristotle, the character must be set up for failure even though this character has the personality of a ""good character."" The show , ""follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear,"" (Aristotle, 2).  Meaning this, the overall sense and focus of the play should not be based on the hero losing his ""good."" Instead, the character must make multiple judgements and go through an entire storyline, not aware of the downfall set right for him. The final element of an ideal tragedy is the spectacle and production itself. Although Aristotle does not go fully into the details regarding this element, in paragraph 3, it is noted that "" A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction....because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect"" (Aristotle, 3). Rather than explaining the scenic visuals of the play and visual effects of a ""spectacle,"" Aristotle explains that the true spectacle is the dramatic competition and the tragedy in effect. The best endings is one that is unhappy and shocks the audience. ",2.80701877383148,1.9233620851324

In his efforts to indicate this claim, he incorporates the examples of  Oediupus and Thyestes. In doing this, Aristotle indicates that one of the key features of an ideal tragedy involves an individual that is highly prosperous in order to drive his plot even further. The second element expressed is the trait within a character that allows for a downfall. Aristotle also used Oedipus, Orestes, and other tragic heroes from mythology in order to heavily emphasize that the flaw in the personality. Aristotle mentions that this error in one's character should be due to misjudgment or frailty. Evidently, all these elements influence the overall idea he expressed that to a perfect tragedy an individual must experience a downfall or a reversal of misfortune.

91368bc293b4,ebad26,"Upton Sinclair strengthens his argument that conditions were unsanitary in meat processing factories through describing the various ways in which workers would use or cover up spoiled meat. This included suppressing the odor through the use of borax and glycerin, adding more meat to cover the spoiled meat, filling hams with pickle, chopping spoiled meat to make ""sausage"", selling bad hams as ""Number Three Grade"", and through extracting the bone of bad ham and selling it as boneless ham. Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or odorless products in order to mask the stench. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair's claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with unspoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieaces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as ""Number Three Grade"" or ""smoked ham"". Later however, ""they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"" (Sinclair 1906).

Throughout this article it tells us that no matter the color, flavor, or smell they would still sell the meat. These factories didn't care for the health of their consumers and only wanted to make money, so they sold every piece of meat that they could. While reading this article it sounds like they would never let a single piece of meat go to waste even if it was spoiled and covered in mold. In the article it states, “old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.”(3). This quote from the article explains to us how they covered up the molded meat by using strong and toxic chemicals to get rid of the smell and turn the meat back to brown. The factories had no health regulations, the meat was stored in places infested with germs. The factories knew how filthy their facility was and had put no effort in  to change it. In paragraph 4 it states, “There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.”(4). This tells us how nobody cared about the condition the meat was in and how no one enforced them to follow any guidelines that had been put in place. Workers knew that what they were doing was wrong and never second guessed it, “a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.”(4). This quote from the article tells the reader how they used rat meat for sausages. These rats contained many diseases and carried poison from eating contaminated  bread. Which they thought was right to feed  humans. In the factories, spoiled meat was covered up badly.

The vizier ensured that taxes were collected. Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employees had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt — they could read and write. Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods. Nobles enjoyed great status and also grew wealthy from donations to the gods. All Egyptians—from pharaohs to farmers—gave gifts to the gods.Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces. Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. Naturally, there were people needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public.At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles. Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest—that’s a lot of hay! Social mobility was not impossible. A small number of peasants and farmers moved up the economic ladder. Families saved money to send their sons to village schools to learn trades. These schools were run by priests or by artisans. Boys who learned to read and write could become scribes, then go on to gain employment in the government. It was possible for a boy born on a farm to work his way up into the higher ranks of the government. Bureaucracy proved lucrative.",-0.382272237741744,-1.79549080344932

The Middle class was connected to the government because they either helped the pharaoh directly, or they had sustainable jobs to sell things to people, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tribute paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods... Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces"" (paragraph, 6 and 8). The nobles and soldiers held the Middle class, because they weren't as wealthy as the pharaohs, but they had more money than the peasants, farmers, and slaves. The Lower class was connected to the government, because their jobs paid for their homes and food, ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toild at the discretion of the pharaohs or nobles. Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest- that's a lot of hay!"" (paragraph, 11 and 12). All of the pieces of social structure were connected to the government, they were either the government, or they had to pay the government.

Aristotle believes that the character of a tragedy should not be a villain and nor should it be a hero as this creates fundamental flaws within the emotions of the reader which brings me to the second element of an ideal tragedy.  The second element of an ideal tragedy is that the emotions and experiences had by the character must appear relatable to the reader as these are the precise emotions that a tragedy aims to make the reader feel.  By allowing the reader to actually feel tragedy they are left with the emotions of a tragic conclusion which brings me to the final aspect of an ideal tragedy.  The final element of a proper tragedy is that the conclusion must remain tragic; meaning that the character must not see his conditions reverse.  By allowing the character to remain in tragedy even through the end of the story the author allows the reader to bask in the emotions that are ever-present in a successful tragedy.,2.19286538414915,2.97504546224614

By this, he means that a tragedy should make the audience feel a lot of different emotions but mostly pity and fear. They should pity the main character but also fear them because they will eventually become bad. Another element he highlights is a lapse in judgment, he writes, ""— that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,5 but by some error of judgment or frailty."". One man cannot be good nor bad but simply make a mistake. A good tragedy is when the man is just a normal person who takes the wrong turn or makes a deadly mistake that results in a series of alarming events. The final element he discusses is an unhappy ending.  Aristotle explains, ""many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending."". Tragedies should end unhappily.

Relating to the character can help the readers feel more understandable of the incident that the character goes through, and because the character has to be relatable to the audience, the audience will see a little part of themselves in the character, which makes them feel pity.

They had control over all their subjects and citizens. They usually were built pyramids for their tombs. Under the Pharoah was a minister or vizier. The vizier's job was to collect taxes and to make sure everyone paid them.  Scribes worked with the vizier because they held government records. Scribes were important because they could read and write.  Then there were nobles and priests. Priests would feed and please the gods to make them happy.  Nobles would hold government posts and they profited from the gifts. There were also soldiers who would fight in wars. And workers such as craftsmen and women and physicians. They were in the middle class.  Then there were the merchants who sold goods to the citizens who bought them. At the bottom, there were farmers and slaves. The slaves were captured prisoners and they would be forced to work on buildings. Farmers did a lot for the Egyptians. They would take care of animals, tended the fields that provided food, kept canals, and worked in quarries. They did all this work and had to pay more than 50 % of their harvest in taxes. The social classes were involved because the people who worked for the Pharoah were at the top of the pyramid. The middle was merchants, craftsmen and woman, jewelers, and more.

The first main element for a tragedy to be ideal is for it to follow a complex plan and/or plot. The twists and turns of the storyline should not be easily predicted by the readers. Furthermore, the narrative the writer is trying to tell his audience should always end in leaving the readers and the character(s) unhappy. In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a relatable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion. An ""error of judgment or frailty,"" to be exact. This element is important because it creates further pity and fear for the readers to feel towards the character.

They were also considered as one of the high classes since they also had an important role in Ancient Egypt. Next there were also soldiers, craftsmen. These people were in the middle, which meant they do have an important role in Ancient Egypt. But there are not much idolized like the pharaohs. These types of people worked hard also because craftsmen and soliders always had to work for the pharaohs will.

They would always have high taxes, make sure they did everything for the pharaohs, and also they were against their will for anything. All of these structures how they worked as a government together was very surprising also because they had a great civilization for many years.

The main character can't be a ""bad man passing from adversity to prosperity"" (Paragraph 2) but also can't be ""a man who is not eminently good and just"" (Paragraph 2). The main character has to be neutral, neither good nor evil. At the same time, a tragedy has to induce pity and fear. A tragedy can't have ""the downfall of the utter villain be exhibited"" (Paragraph 2) because that wouldn't bring fear or pity, but we rejoice instead. For a ideal tragedy, pity should be ""aroused by unmerited misfortune"" (Paragraph 2) and fear by ""the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (Paragraph 2). The final element is that the main characters fortune ""should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (Paragraph 3) and should be caused ""by some error of judgement or frailty"" (Paragraph 2).

c3c5c24e2c62,39c16e,"    According to Aristotle, the ideal tragedy must evoke certain emotions, have a relatable main character, follow a specific plot, and have a particular ending. Early on, Aristotle establishes that the main point of a tragedy is to make the audience feel fear and pity, which requires a certain main character. This character must not be perfect or sinister. That would lead to the audience feeling little pity or fear. The audience would not be able to properly sympathize with this character due to most being somewhere in the middle of those extremes. Additionally, both the plot and ending to a tradegy must show a steep downward spiral regarding this character's life preferably due to human error. That way ,the audience will feel both pity and fear knowing they could have acted similarly. Anything else will not evoke the proper emotions. All in all, Aristotle finds that a lot goes into making the perfect tragedy, specifically having the right character, plot, ending, and emotions from the audience (Aristotle).

Finally, Aristotle writes that while a tragedy should ""be arranged not only the simple but on the complex plan"" but that there should not be a ""double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and bad"" because in that case the sense of pleasure from the audience will not be ""true tragic pleasure"" but closer to what the audience would feel when watching a comedy.",3.90032610436019,0.556479831902046

Additonally, the swap of fortune should be from good to bad rather than bad to good, resulting in an unhappy ending. This, according to Aristotle, hightens the dramatic reaction to the tragedy. Lastly, Aristotle claims the perfect tragedy should be proper instead of comedic, should have conflict such as relationship changes and characters who are slain, and it should have plot in which is ""double-threaded"".

Here is the order from greatest to least: Egyptian Gods/Pharaohs,  nobles/priests, soldiers, craftmen/traders, and lastly farmers/slaves. The gods are at the highest position in status. They have the right to overpower everyone. Also, since everyone praises them they believe that the gods were responsible of many things as well. Like safety. Sometimes the pharaohs direct the army or create laws. As stated in the text, ""They had absolute power over their subjects...The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. All the laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh."" Because the pharaohs/gods couldn't do all the duties themselves they have assistants called viziers which are chief ministers. They have the duty of collecting taxes from people like farmers. According to the article, ""No single person could manage all these duties without assistance. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected."" Called a ""chain of command"" the viziers have assistants as well.  They are called scribes; they are the only ones who can read and write. Now under the whole chain of gods/pharaohs there are the nobles/priests. According to the text, the only people who can develop government posts are the nobles. And priests' duties are to keep the gods satisfied. Like said in the text, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods."" Also, the nobles grow very wealthy from recieving all the gifts of the gods from the subjects. Next are the soldiers. The soldiers fight in wars or end ""domestic uprisings."" Also, they sometimes keep an eye on farmers, peasants, and slaves. As said in the article, ""Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces."" Next comes the middle class which is made up of skilled people life artisans, craftmen/women, and physicians. The craftmen would create jewlery and other products and then sell them to make some money. They were known as the merchants and sorekeepers. ""Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. Naturally, there were people needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public."" And at the bottom/base are the farmers and slaves. The farmers has to raise animals, take care of the fields, conduct some tasks in the stone quarries, construct royal monuments, and are responsible to keep the reservoirs and canals in shape. They also have to pay 60% of their annual harvest towards tax.

Pharaoh's were the next and egyptians believed Pharaoh's were gods but in human forms and they had absolute power over their subjects which is stated on paragraph 2. The pharaoh directed an army  in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict stated on paragraph 3. All laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh. Each farmer paid taxes in the form of grains, which were stored in the pharaoh's warehouses. This grain was used to feed the people in the event of a famine stated on paragraph 3.  The pharaoh appointed a cheif minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected stated on paragraph 4. Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employess had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt, they could read and write stated on paragraph 5. Below pharaoh's were nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts, which in these positions they profited from tributes, paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods stated on paragraph 6. Soliders fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soilders also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building structures like pyramids and palaces stated on paragraph 8. Skilled workers like physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus, products, tools, and other useful things stated on paragraph 9.  There were people that needed to buy goods from artisians and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public stated on paragraph 10.  At the bottom of the social structure were the slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. Being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles stated on paragraph 11. Farmers tended the fields. raised animals, kept canals, and reservoirs in good order, worked in stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could do as much as 60% of their yearly harvest stated on paragraph 12. Social mobility was not impossible. A small number of peasants and farmers moved up the economic ladder. Families saved money to send their sons to village schools to learn trades.  These schools were run by priests or by artisans. Boys who learned to read and write could become scribes, then go on a gain employment in the government stated on paragraph 13.  That is how the system of Ancient Egypt worked.

He went on to describe in detail the horriable unsafe, disgusting, and moraliy wrong prosses that of which the meat was packaged. One thing the industery would do is putting many chemicals into the rotten meat to make it look better so that people would buy it.  As seen in the novel, ""Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell [...] also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose. In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus, by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. [...]  Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.""(Sinclair 2).

In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus, by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor—a process known to the workers as “giving them thirty per cent.” Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad.

eadfbab27103,39c16e,"There are many elements to an ideal tragedy according to ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. To begin with, character is a big element in order to achieve an ideal tragedy. Aristotle talks about how a character should not be a bad man or virtuos man, but a man in between those two extremes. A man who is not eminently good and just, yet their downfall is caused byerror of judgement or frailty. Some examples are Oedupis or Thyestes. This is because they are relatable to the viewers and pity or excitement can not be aroused  from simple adversity to prosperity or prosperity to adversity. Another key element is the plot. It should be a single plot where change of fortune should be from good to bad. Some of the greatest tragedies like the fortunes of Oedipus or Alcmaeon can back this up. Lastly, the ending is also a major facet of the ideal tragedy. Although the ending may not satisfy the viewers, if done right, it can be the most tragic like Euripides.",2.55061546647052,2.4614138382119

eb76bd210a89,39c16e,"One element of an ideal tragedy, as summarized by Aristotle, is that there should be a serious change in circumstances of the main character, specifically a change from good circumstances to bad, instead of bad to good. Aristotle says ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" Aristotle argues that if the fortune changed from bad to good, then it wouldn't invoke any feelings of pity in us, as it wouldn't be considered a tragedy if a character's fortune increased throughout the play, as this would be a good thing. Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad. He says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" Essentially, Aristotle is saying that the main character shouldn't be too good, as this wouldn't invoke any pity, however, the character also shouldn't be too evil, or else the audience wouldn't feel sorry for him and his bad misfortune. Lastly, Aristotle says a good tragedy should exhibit a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in his character, not necessarily because of bad or immoral behaviror. He says ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse."" Overall, Aristotle argues that a good tragedy should portray a character who is neither good nor bad, but rather somewhere in the middle, who experiences a change of fortune from good to bad due to some inherent flaw of his character.

Evoking pity and fear from an audience are staples to a basic tragedy because such strong emotions practically entice the audience into the story; the audience may be able to see themselves in the story presented. The downfall of the story's villain in a tragedy should not be included because such event would only satisfy the audience and their moral sense. Pity and fear would not come from a villain's downfall because the evil had been defeated for the sake of what is ""good"" in the story.

ee49145aa624,39c16e,"The Greek philosopher Aristotle described an ideal tragedy in literature in many defining aspects.  One of these is that a tragedy is complicated and heightens emotions such as remorse and fright as in the reader as the plot moves along.  Aristotle concludes, ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.""  Due to this, Aristotle indicates how tragedies should be deeply thought out to provide an emotional experience in a reader.  Furthermore, a second aspect is how the changes throughout the plot will lead to a downfall of a character or event.  He demonstrates that the change should be ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.""  Moreover, a third aspect of a tragedy is that the plot and storyline should follow one strict and sole storyline that will lead to the eventual negative outcome.  Aristotle suggests, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""  To summarize, 3 elements of a tragedy from Aristotle are strong emotions stirring in a reader, the defeat of a major character or events in the plot, and one plotline that strictly follows the issue of this story until the tragic ending.",2.83495109138843,3.14321133114365

In the chapter from Poetics, Aristotle states, ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged... on the complex plan"" (Paragrapgh 2). When Aristole says this, he means that there should be actions that entertain pity, fear, and bring in the ""tragic"" part of the writing. There has to be a bundle of emotions to make the audience feel a certain way for the character. In the chapter from Poetics, Aristotle also states, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issure, rather than double as some maintain"" (Paragraph 3). This means that there should be a plot that goes from good to bad. This provides an emotional connection to the character with their successes, but as the ""bad"" part comes in, you wil feel for the character. In the chapter from Poetics,  Aristotle states, ""It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the speactator; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience"" (Paragraph 4). If you write the ending in the audiences wishes, they will be more intrigued. It's in the best wishes that the poet ends the writing in the audiences wishes, it will result in pleasure.

Sinclair states that ""some ingenious person had hit upon a new device"" where they would ""extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay"" in order to get rid of grades for the meats (Sinclair 2). Even though a bad part of the meat was being extracted, the way it was done was still unsanitary and it was used as a scheme by the meatpacking industry to appeal to the greater population. The meatpacking industry found another way to increase productivity by ""fill[ing] a ham with pickle in a few seconds"" through the process of using a ""needle into the meat and working with his foot"" in order to make the meat last longer, even at the cost of ruining its sanitation (Sinclair 2). The fact that the workers would use their feet in the process indicated how the meatpacking industry was corrupt when it came to providing sanitary ham's to the population and that it would find any way possible to increase productivity and cover-up spoiled meat.

ff21b97ae290,3b9047,"The social structure greatly resembeld the Egyptians mighty pyramids;  The smaller, more powerful and valued group at the top, and the larger less valued group at the bottom. The social structure had three different groups. At the top where the Pharoes, Nobles, Priests, and scribes who played large roles in the government. Scribes kept important governemnt documents, Priests where in charge of pleasing the gods, Nobles held certain government posts, and the greatest of all, Pharoes, where thought to be the ruler and or god of the land. ""All Egyptians-from pahroes to farmers-gave gifts to the gods."" Although some roles might have higher value than others, all people give gifts to the gods. The Middle class was made up of soldiers, craftsmen/ women, artisans, physicians and traders. Soldiers helped keep their community safe, craftsmen/ women  created beautiful  jewelery, artisans made pottery and other forms of art, physicians kept people healthy and traders sold goods and food. ""Naturally, there were people needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These where the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public."" This evidence from the text demonstrats a way that the middle class can contribuite to the economic system of their community. The last, and largest social group, is made up of farmers and slaves. The farmers would grow crops to consume and sell and pay taxes to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest. The slaves who were captured in war, and would work on building projects and would be the servants to pharoes or nobles. Although some people are born into the lower class, you can still move up the social scale. ""Families saved money to send their sons to village schools to learn trades...schools were run by priests or artisans."" If the son succed in school he would go to get an important job in the government. In conclusion, that is the role of each character in the social structure and how they contribuite to the government.",2.41216874628467,2.26157336440084
