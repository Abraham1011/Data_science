0,The Woman in Me,Unbelievably impressive. Her torn life on paper.,Murderess Marbie,4,"I'm only a third way in. Shipped lightening fast.The print quality of the book is very good. I like the rose and the purple foil, they captured her taste here and will look bomb on my bookshelf.As for the writing it's good. Amazing, no. But they painted an incredible picture of her life. Much better writing than I thought to be honest. I was expecting more scattered blurbs throughout the book but the way it's presented does honor her experience, and sounds like her up to an extent. Now, I do think the ghost writer went verbose in some areas that were unnecessary which derailed her voice in my head but I imagine getting the whole picture would be difficult.I was hoping for a thicker book as she's been through a lot. So I am a bit disappointed at that but nevertheless it's an interesting read thus far.As for Britney's life story. I have to say they were smart in starting with her lineage and she didn't hold back keeping her family accountable from the gate. Good on her for having conviction.I suddenly found myself understanding little quirks, connecting the dots, certain things would suddenly click in my head. For example her British accent and her relationship with a lynchpin matriarch elder.Very cool build up. Laying the ground work for her future decisions by presenting us with complex childhood family dynamics really has me understanding her choices and quirks much better than I ever realized I needed to be deep in thought of.Sometimes we judge from a place of pity or outsider perspective instead of compassion. Now I see the soft gentle feminine side of her mindset that we knew when she was younger start to peek through the pages. It's that sweet part of her soul that she doesn't show much nowadays, for good reason of course as she's been deeply hurt and damaged by other's greed, but that delicate nature is part of why most of us were charmed by her. I hope she finds her way back one day.She's been through a lot and I found myself relating to things she'd been through, and feeling deeply saddened by her sense of insecurity in childhood. Her insights correlate along with many of my own life experiences and traumas. I was taken aback by her growth in reflection, as one would believe anger would be the easy way to portray her story, not the case here, it's her appreciation for her past that has earned my deep respect beyond what I thought I had possessed prior to reading.Her story with her brother was touching and softened my distain for his participation in the matter of handling her affairs. Although I hope he is held accountable someday. It shows how loving and innocent she was and how grave a loss she has suffered, for it is those who are selfless that don't speak up only to suffer the most.Such a contrast to the presentation of her character in the media. Thus far this book is an excellent read!------ To be Continued* I'm looking forward to reading through this book in it's entirety and will update when I'm done. One star for the writing not sounding like her in some places. I will change accordingly.",TRUE,26-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2023",1668009048
1,The Woman in Me,What a heartbreaking story,L J,5,"""There have been so many times when I was scared to speak up because I was afraid somebody would think I was crazy. But I've learned that lesson now, the hard way. You have to speak the thing that you're feeling, even if it scares you. You have to tell your story. You have to raise your voice.""What a heartbreaking story. Whatever you feel about Britney this memoir makes you understand and have empathy for all the things that have made headlines in her life. It took me a little bit to get into it because though people believed this was going to be ghostwritten, I believe the editors tried to keep it raw and in her voice so it does jump around a little bit and the flow can be off, but it feels authentically Britney. I got to a point where I couldn't put it down...and then there were parts I had to put it down because it was very difficult to read what she went through.I don't think I will look at any of her past interviews or performances the same and I wish her the best.In speaking of when her family forced her into a mental health facility after refusing to do a second tour in Vegas and wanting to change up dance moves in a performance:""God must have been with me through that period of time. Three months into my confinement, I started to believe that my little heart, whatever made me Britney, was no longer inside my body anymore. Something bigger must have been carrying me through, because it was too much for me to bear alone. I look at the fact that I survived and I think, ""that wasn't me; that was God.""",TRUE,06-11-2023,"Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2023",1668009048
2,The Woman in Me,Britney you are so invincible! You are an inspiration and helped motivate me to be strong like you.,Jamie,5,"The media could not be loaded. I personally have been in the same exact situations as some of these in Britney‚Äôs memoir. My son‚Äôs father illegally withheld my son from me for 72 days when I have primary physical custody and sole legal custody. The police won‚Äôt take a child from a parents care regardless of court order! The court system is a joke and didn‚Äôt help at all. I am an unemployed single mother, so I didn‚Äôt have a lawyer and no one in my family would help me because my parents don‚Äôt have that kind of money and my nana and pop passed away. (All I have) It wasn‚Äôt until I filed an emergency hearing after all my other petitions were denied, to finally be seen at court to get my son back. The father even then refused so eventually after educating myself online for 65 days and countless hours of research, I made a petition asking the judge for police to use force as necessary to ensure I get my son back this time. A little more than a week later the judge granted it. The pain, emotional turmoil, absolute defeat, despair, depression, anxiety, grief, guilt, helplessness, and being put down by everyone you thought was family and loved you. I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong either. I had my son 24/7 with NO help from anyone, his whole 5 years of life. Working side jobs taking care of an old woman and cleaning dirty toilets to provide what he needed. Those sleepless nights crying wondering why this happened, what your child is thinking or being told, if he thinks he was abandoned when you‚Äôre showing up with police escorts and every day fighting to get your child back, but your son doesn‚Äôt know that! In my situation, that whole petty situation was over my jealous sister trying to get me kicked out to take my room (master bedroom, my sons bedroom, and a master bathroom) I spent $7,000 renovating (old neglected house) and the father not wanting to pay child support, so they ganged up on us to be vindictive at the stake of my sons emotional and mental well-being. ($170 every two weeks only visits dad 6-8 days a month depending on how many weeks are in the month) People are CRUEL! You are only as good as you are giving. Once your hand closes, you will have NO ONE! My son is still struggling 5 months later with the emotional turmoil from the trauma they caused him. He‚Äôs having outbursts in school because of the trauma! I still am also traumatized every time his visitation at his father comes. I worry I‚Äôll never see my child again, and yes sometimes it makes me want to hide him too! For anyone to judge you and your choices when you were literally helpless walking through the gates of hell and trembling with every step, taking every single low blow, and still not giving up. Doing it all alone, no help! Evil experiences almost always revolve around MONEY and EVIL PEOPLE! You are INVINCIBLE! No one will ever understand until they walk in those shoes. Don‚Äôt you ever underestimate your resilience and strength. You are strong, you are amazing, you are beautiful, you can do it! What those people did to you, that were supposed to love you but instead used you to profit off your hard work, prosperity, and dedication, I hope karma comes for them HARD. I can not imagine the trauma you have been through, especially living under a microscope with hundreds of dangerous paparazzi men hungry for money and seeing your grief and pain, profiting off your downfall when you were on top of the world, chasing you and your children around with such disrespect and disregard to how that would affect your children and your emotional and mental health, is disgusting. You were put in fight or flight mode, given ptsd, betrayed, and locked up like a prisoner. While everyone took all of your money you worked hard for, building your empire for the family you always dreamed of creating. Please stay strong, and keep fighting for your happiness. You deserve to live the life of your wildest dreams, you deserve to be the happy woman that got to enjoy doing what she loved! You deserve to do what you want when you want! You are worth it! You know who you are, what you‚Äôve done, and what YOU ARE CAPABLE OF!

3,The Woman in Me,"Fast Read, Sad Story",KMG,5,"I have been a fan of Britney's music since the '00s. She is just a couple years older than me. I didn't love how she dressed or how sexy she was on the TV screen, because I felt like I was expected to look and act just like her - at the time. She definitely influenced fashion and hair and young women's actions. However, that is not entirely her fault.The paparazzi was INSANE around her. There were so many tabloids and photos taken of her throughout the years that by the time I reached age 17 or 18, I refused to purchase or even PICK UP a magazine while standing at the store checkout- in solidarity with Britney. What they did to her was disgusting, invasive and abusive. It makes my skin crawl, just thinking about it.But, her music was fire. The mixture of dub step rhythms with her music was so fun and energetic. I still listen to it from time to time and dance.The book was written pretty simply. You can see that she has done some therapy and has gained some insight into her life, her history. She is trying to understand why she did the things she did and why she trusted those she trusted. The kinds of betrayals she has endured in the past two decades will need some serious CBT to re-write those neuropathways into a healthier train of thought.Our society is still learning what entails ""abuse"" and what does not. I've definitely felt my share of emotional and psychological abuse. It hangs inside of your thoughts long after you've stopped being around those people. You must be constantly diligent to stop those negative thoughts toward yourself and to re-write what your mind says to you. You hear what your mind tells you WAY more often than you hear negative words from others. You are with YOU 100% of the time. There's nowhere to run. So, you need to become your own best friend.I hope this book was written by her and that she is receiving the payments from purchases. I hope that she wrote it and it was done with her consent. I find the timing of the release of this book crucial- but, maybe if I was released from ""prison"", I would run to publish my side of the story, too. I would have probably been writing in journals the entire time.I hope she heals. She seems to be on her way. I hope she simplifies her life and stops letting outsiders inside of her mind. The book was easy to read, doesn't get TOO DEEP into her psyche. It is very surface level. She is TELLING her story. it's not super deep or introspective or thought provoking in any particular way. I am definitely confused as to why the conservatorship was done in the first place, and then held for 13 years- but I was already informed about that before the book. I read the book in 2 and 1/2 hours.Many times, I wished that she would tell more details of one story or other. But, so much of her life has been an invasion of privacy, that I understand maybe she doesn't want to allow more than just the surface level story out there. It's her choice.",TRUE,25-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2023",1668009048
4,The Woman in Me,"Buy it, it‚Äôs worth the read!",Stephanie Brown,5,"Whether or not you‚Äôre a fan, it‚Äôs a great read. Britney takes you in her world and shares her perspective of how hateful the tabloid, tv hosts, and paparazzi was, and still is, to her. The vile, hateful, ignorant comments towards her that people got away with in the 2000‚Äôs is incomprehensible really. All the while she stood tall taking every blow and silently suffered through it. She was always perceived as dumb but I never thought that, she carried herself with dignity and gave everyone respect even if they didn‚Äôt reciprocate it. From what I‚Äôve gathered by reading her words, she didn‚Äôt have a enough people in her corner looking out for her. The struggles she shared about motherhood I felt so connected to, it‚Äôs difficult enough experiencing it in the comfort of your own home with people who love you and care about you, but to experience that all while the world was watching and scrutinizing everything you do seems agonizing. Society still sets impossible standards for women and mothers. But men can do something as simple as take their kids to school and be sung as heroes. The judgment you feel amongst your own community of fellow parents is hard and can really make you second guess yourself as a parent, but on the scale of a celebrity, it seems impossible to do any good or anything right. I can‚Äôt ever imagine putting my kid through any of the horrible experiences her own family put her through. But not everyone is fit to be a parent, and from what I‚Äôve read her parents fit that mold very well. Overall it is an exceptionally well written book and full of quirky humor that sheds a warm light on the Britney I grew up watching, loving, and admiring. Her strength and grit is unmatched. I hope this gives her solace and she thrives from this point on to find herself.",TRUE,01-11-2023,"Reviewed in the United States November 1, 2023",1668009048
5,The Woman in Me,A must-read for anyone who's seeking freedom or overcoming imposter syndrome,Leanne S.,5,"I had to finish the book in a week, because I needed breaks. Although it's a quick-read - it reads lyrical, like her music, very catchy and vivid, it's dark, like the color of the cover.If everything stated in the memoir is true, shouldn't her father and his posse be arrested, or at least sued for fraud or abuse?Is it just me or do her parents resemble Jefferey Epstein and Ghislane Maxwell who kept Britney as a ""sex slave"" for 13 years, just to use her body to create cash flow?Why is it when she's flying solo the families fell apart (parents divorced, sister tried to disown them), and when she's under conservatorship her family got reunited (parents got back together, watching Criminal Minds every night; and sister and father bonded).When she became an icon, she became a ""thing"" people would judge or vent on. She never had a life, and because of that, her growth, or womanhood, was stunted. She talked about what meant ""everything"" to her, music, family, sons..., It's saddening to learn that, in the end, the simple desires of having ""everything"" almost killed her. It became worse when she had no one to help. Or maybe people were just preoccupied with their own struggles, as always.Among her ordeal, she noted people she drew inspirations from, Madonna, J.Lo, Reese Witherspoon..., and the ""woman"" in her that had been suppressed for decades.That's what happened. Not fair and horrific. Her kind soul and eager for happiness eventually set her free from imprisonment. Hope she will make up and catch up with life.",TRUE,06-11-2023,"Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2023",1668009048
6,The Woman in Me,Our Queen has spoken!,Kayce,5,"The world has had access to Britney Spears' memoir for one week and bookstagram is flooded with opinions and reviews. But since this is the latest KAYCE 5 STAR I have to tell you why and leave you MY full review:I've been a Britney fan since day one and have seen the relentless paparazzi coverage of her for 20 years. Everyone has an opinion on Britney, judge her and think they know everything based on what they've seen in magazines and online. Finally speaking for herself, this memoir tells us about all those stories we think we knew but from HER perspective.While the memes and reels about Justin are pretty funny since this came out, Britney went through a very traumatic experience with him (you know the one) and our girl held that in for TWENTY YEARS. And why wouldn't she? That's an incredibly personal decision and all the while, the media villainized her and praised him. I really don't care what Justin thinks about Britney's revelations. He made his choices then and she's making her choices now. Never once does she victimize herself but simply tells us how she felt through all the ups and downs. Personally and professionally.You get fun stories too about her favorite album, favorite performances, celebs she admires and more. Britney admits she is not good at fame (girl, we know and none of us would be either). If Britney never gets on another stage for the rest of her life I wouldn't blame her for one second. But given how healing music is for her, I wouldn't be surprised if we got more music one day. And if it's on her terms I bet it will be the best she's ever released.Since THE WOMAN IN ME is just 275 pages I thought it would feel short and unfinished but she did a great job recapping up to present day. She's so brave and stronger than she realizes and her love for her sons is on every page. Cheers to Britney, may she continue to heal and surround herself with people who love her and don't want to use or exploit her. She still has her beautiful heart despite everything and I think that's a huge testament to her strength.Highly recommend my bestie's memoir. 5 stars!",TRUE,31-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2023",1668009048
7,The Woman in Me,"Beyond the Content, Lies the Conversation",Thomas Ward,5,"I absolutely adored every minute of this audiobook! While the stories are heart-wrenching and even somewhat uncomfortable to hear, you have to admire the sheer amount of bravery and fortitude it took for Britney to finally sit down and tell her side of the story. Is it the, as a court would say, ""the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"" We'll never know, because we are the outside spectators to these stories, many of which we're only hearing for the first time. Many of the stories that are contained within these pages are so steeped in lore and speculation that discerning the actual truth would be about as likely as proving the existence of God or coming up with a satisfactory solution to the abortion issue. What is true about this book, however, is that its existence will allow for a bigger conversation to take place, not just around the issues of mental health, but of the sensationalization of media coverage, the brutal realities of being a ""wind-up doll"" for public consumption, and the ethics of a mental health conservatorship. I applaud Britney, as well as Michelle Williams, for both bringing this book, and these stories, to both light and life. I recommend that anyone who has ever been curious about Britney's life, or any of the other concepts I've mentioned, read this book immediately and often!",TRUE,02-11-2023,"Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2023",1668009048
8,The Woman in Me,"In her words, heartbreaking and hopeful",katereviews,5,"Her life and story told in her words. Britney Spears has had an expansive career and her face has been splattered on many covers of magazines accompanied by stories that photos and showed whatever it took to make those people rich.

She speaks of happiness, joy, sadness, trauma, love, rejection, rumors, heartache, and being used by so many people around her. People who should have loved, protected, and guided her. Her early days when she truly felt joy in the music and dance. How that became an escape for her. She talks about her love life, setting records straight. There is no finger-pointing or blame. Just the truth about who she loved, how she loved, and her dreams for life.She talks about her boys. In a way that all mothers can relate to. Her desperation to just be able to see them, to be able to be with them. How they were used as a weapon. Used to get her to perform. Her experiences with the paparazzi how relentless and cruel they were. As a mother, I can't imagine what I would have done.

10,"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir","Not Really a ""Kiss and Tell"" but Maybe a ""Drug and Tell""",California Dreaming,4,"I'll admit, I rarely watched ""Friends"" when episodes first aired. My wife started binge watching it a couple years ago or so, probably during the pandemic, and so I started watching it with her. I do think that I was a little too hard on the show though as I always thought that it was a bit of a ""Seinfeld"" ""rip-off."" In reality there are enough differences in the shows that now, after watching the entire series of each, I've relaxed my criticism. A bit.And I rarely read autobiographies, or what people usually call ""memoirs"" nowadays. I usually am reading true-crime books, in particular those about serial killers. I did read ""C'mon, Get Happy: Fear and Loathing on the Partridge Family Bus"" (CGH) from David Cassidy in 2021 and I actually liked Mr. Cassidy LESS after reading his memoir. I kind of wish I wouldn't have read CGH and just remembered him instead from his time on the show. It's just that I found Mr. Cassidy to be a bit of a braggart while reading and while I finished CGH I was struggling to even care towards the end. I'm guessing that Susan Dey felt the same. Ahem.Now, rarely does Matthew Perry ""brag"" during ""Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir"" (FLB) about himself. He does discuss how much money he made during filming of ""Friends,"" and I don't have a problem with that, mostly because he discusses how David Schwimmer actually was instrumental in negotiating a great deal for the entire cast and not just for Mr. Schwimmer. In reality Mr. Perry is far more self-deprecating in FLB than Mr. Cassidy is in CGH. Mr. Perry doesn't seem to hide much when it comes to his struggles with addiction and if he does underplay it, well, he must be REALLY bad. Mr. Perry discusses how he was taking up to 55 pain killers a day and that is extreme. For those who don't know, pain killers tend to dry you out and slow down digestion so I have no idea how someone could take that many for any length of time and survive.Well, Mr. Perry almost didn't survive.Mr. Perry was rushed by a friend from one of his many stints in rehab to the hospital and the people running the rehab facility tried to stop him. If they had been successful Mr. Perry surely would've died. Heck, he still should've died in the hospital even though he had probably the best care that money could buy. From memory he said that only ""two percent of people survive on the machine required to keep him alive,"" and I think he also called it a ""Hail Mary.""Overall I really liked FLB and I actually read it in one day. As a matter of fact I couldn't sleep last night and kept picking up my Kindle device and would continue reading. Usually readers might say, ""I couldn't put it down!"" but I might say, ""I couldn't leave it down."" Over and over I picked up my device, opened the Kindle app, and continued from my last bookmark. Luckily for me Kindle apps save the bookmark for me and that's only one of the reasons I tend to almost only read digital. I will buy a paperback or a hardcover version but only if I MUST read a book and there is no digital version.But still FLB is not a ""perfect book,"" far from it. Towards the end I think that Mr. Perry starts to repeat himself and I got the feeling that he was on a tight deadline and just hammered out the last few chapters. I don't know if he first created an outline -- I think that all authors should do so at an early phase in writing -- but I think a good outline would've really helped create a more polished effort. It's also the case that Mr. Perry has a tendency to use too many parentheticals and that becomes a bit of a distraction for the reader.Not that it bothers me but it might bother some readers: Mr. Perry does discuss religion, or at least God, quite a bit towards the end. If religion is a turnoff, I think that FLB may not be for you. Mr. Perry does seem to think that God helped keep him alive, maybe even helped him break some addictions, and that is fine by me. I can't prove it either way, and it is Mr. Perry's memoir, so he has a right to think and write whatever he chooses. Personally, I appreciate his honesty.Mr. Perry does admit going into open houses and swiping pain meds from home sellers and that reminded me a lot of Ryan Leaf. I think that Mr. Leaf used to do the same thing and it got that ex-NFL player quite a few years in prison for it. From a legal standpoint if I were Mr. Perry, and I were writing a memoir, I think I might not have disclosed this. I am not a lawyer and I don't know what legal troubles it could cause him now.There has been quite a bit of noise about how Mr. Perry tends to ""kiss and tell"" and I think that's overblown a bit. He does discuss how he and Valerie Bertinelli made out within just a few feet of Eddie Van Halen, after Mr. Van Halen had passed out from drinking too much wine. Hey, I guess I've been there myself so I won't judge. Um, from Mr. Van Halen's perspective and not necessarily from Mr. Perry's. But Mr. Perry doesn't really dwell on it too much. I can understand how Ms. Bertinelli feels about the disclosure although of course Mr. Van Halen is no longer with us. If Mr. Van Halen were still alive I believe that Mr. Perry probably wouldn't even bring it up. Just a guess.Well, if you're a fan of ""Friends"" and Matthew Perry, and you like to read memoirs, I'll give a fairly strong recommendation for ""Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing."" If you don't fit that criteria perhaps you might want to read something else. But if you're a fan of David Cassidy from ""The Partridge Family"" I'll recommend you pass on his memoir. Sometimes it's better to only remember the good things about your heroes, after all.",TRUE,02-11-2022,"Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2022",1250866448
11,"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir",An Absolute Rollercoaster,Cindy R.,4,"I purchased Matthew Perry's book last year when it was published and have had it on my list of books to read. I finally read it yesterday in one sitting. Wow! I have never written a book review on Amazon, but after I finished reading, I felt compelled to leave a review. I knew he had a serious drug habit, but had no idea the extent of his addiction. It was difficult to read parts of the book, but I could not put it down. I have watched Friends for years and still watch the reruns, and it was always obvious to me how much his physical appearance was affected by his drug and alcohol use (having family members with this disease). I found the book actually exhausting to read - just when I thought it could not get worse, it did. I think it is so sad that he had such a tormented life, right from the beginning, and he was never truly able to enjoy his success. I was so sad to hear of his passing at such a relatively young age, but not really surprised (even though his cause of death has not yet been determined). After reading this brutally honest memoir, I find it surprising that he lived as long as he did - I was shocked to learn the extent of abuse his body endured. It's not the same watching Friends now, knowing he's gone and knowing what he went through while on the show.

12,"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir",I hope you read this book,P. Huffman,5,"I just finished Mathew's book. I did not realize until I was almost done with his story that it could have been my father's story accept, my father died after getting septic from colon cancer surgery. He too had a fistula and they gave him liquids which spilled out and killed him. Dad drank, smoked, and took all the same drugs Mathew did. My Dad rejected AA because of step two. My Dad had an irrational fear of ""insanity"". My father saw shrinks and they gave him drugs to treat the fear and anxiety. My Dad had seven children with four different woman and many woman on the side. Mathew, my Dad and myself were abandoned at a critical time when we were vulnerable children. I think my Dad, Mathew and I were and are driven by the desire to have that feeling of safety and comfort we lost early in life if it ever really existed. Maybe we are trying to find that feeling of safety and comfort we imagine only exists for others. I also believe that that 'feeling' in the gut of anxiety and fear can be about a screwed up digestive track made worse by relationships, drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. Relationships, drugs, alcohol and cigarettes cause and treat the discomfort of fear and anxiety. These substances and behaviors seem to bring relief but only for a moment and then they make it worse. I think the absence of depression and anxiety can be from the absence of an irritable bowel and peace of mind. Mathew was born with colic his stomach was a problem from the start.This is a list of some of the substances he used.Constant crying from colic Mathew was drugged withphenobarbital so his parents could sleep.DilaudidSuboxoneValiumXanax.At one point he was addicted to six milligrams of Ativan a day.boozeOxy is what blew up Mathew's colon. The warm honey feeling he describes from the oxy paralyzes the gut bringing on depression and anxiety. At one point Mathew did sixty pills a day. My Dad suffered from Oxy. I experienced it too.All this stuff impacts mood. Depression, fear, anxiety. Fear of depression, anxiety and fear. The same feelings of abandonment, fear and anxiety a small child feels [I felt] when I became aware I was abandoned. These feelings are alive and well in Mathew's and my body and they can be triggered by 'something happening good or bad' I don't like to leave my house because just pulling out of my driveway is stressful.After reading the book I can better understand myself and my Dad. I was not present for my life and I mistreated the people I love while seeking relief from my addiction/discomfort. I even became co-dependent in recovery by trying to replace the substances with gurus. I too had the spiritual experience that made me feel completely loved and free from my insanity. It lasted until I tried to talk about it with other people who did not ""get it"". I was distracted by their lack of appreciation for what I was saying.After reading this book I feel like I have been in rehab for a week. I see my disease better. Mathew Perry lived the unbelievable nightmare of mental illness and lived to tell about it. We focus on the substance when that substance is really just an attempt to treat the real problem. Is self-awareness of the core issue enough to free oneself from the intolerable agony of having paralyzing feelings of being discarded and fearing it will happen again and again. Even if only just by the president of the PTA. Isolation is the only way I knew to protect myself from fulfilling the prophecy my sister made to me. She said I would never have any friends. I was eight years old. She was nine. I believed her. I was all alone on Rancho Drive. I had no friends not even my sister. Just the word ""friends"" can trigger my discomfort. No matter how many people I call friend I can not dispel that belief. The big secret I carry is I believe I have no value. When people treat me as though I have no value I want to die. Mathew said it annihilated him to be left. Annihilated describes the feeling I want to avoid the most. Until now I could not think of a word strong enough to convey my discomfort. Annihilation feels right. Sadly, whenever I risked talking about this belief, I was told to ""get over it"". That would be fine accept it is who I think I am. Can I just get over it?What or how would I know if I were over it?""I want God to always be there for me now, whenever I clear my channel to feel his awesomeness.""I hope you read the book.",TRUE,11-12-2022,"Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2022",1250866448

He truly had such great comedic timing and he brought such life to every part he played. I had always known he had suffered from addiction and had been in rehab several times but I never realized just how horrible his addiction was and for how many years he fought it.I was so saddened to hear of his death earlier this week. I hope he continued to be sober and enjoy life as he stated he was at the end of this book. It's so sad that someone that had seemingly all their dreams come true, starred in a once in a lifetime show, and was so accomplished was also so miserable during all of it that he never enjoyed it.

14,"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir",The One with the Double Review,mandylouplus3,3,"So, I will review this as two people: A writer and masters of writing student and as a fan of Matthew Perry:Hey Matthew,So, we know you can write. At least I knew you did, after I had read interviews on Mr. Sunshine a bunch of years back. You wrote a sitcom, so I knew you could probably put words together. I am glad I read this as someone who is currently reading for a degree. We have been taught to analyze, something I just do now no matter what I read, and this one was interesting. It began well enough, and your words were put together nicely. I usually like it when we move back in forth time, but in this instance, it was little too much, especially considering we changed places so often: California, to New Mexico, to Switzerland, to New York. It was time AND place jumping, which in writing, you have to do very carefully. What bothers me, is editors should have picked this up. There should have been better breaks between time/place changes and or labels (you could have been very creative here, like using the ""Friends"" way of labeling, 'The One where My Colon Explodes' or 'The one where I tried to get sober in Switzerland'.) I wish I could have been an editor on this book. It would have made a little more sense. You're supposed to write with the audience in mind, and I don't know if this is what happened. Seemed like it was more of a therapy assignment for you. But what do I know? I once got into a fight without taking my hoops out. Sometimes I don't know jack.The thing with memoirs is, that you can't write this in a way that constitutes a running thought because we're getting real facts with dates. As it turns out, the two most important things in the book (And why we wanted to read about your life) were a little too muddy to always keep straight. If you have to re-read to understand something multiple times, it becomes less and less fun to read. Running thoughts are great when you talk about the hook ups and minute details, but the structure was missing for the meat and potatoes (ya dig?) I write fiction, but we can also use the same ideology that we do use there: that there are rules, even within non-fiction writing, that things can be said too much and all at once. We want to know how 'Matty' (can I call you that?) talks about addiction. The horrors of addiction are real and true, and any addict knows this, but there should have been (editing? paging an editor...) a little more of an even grading downwards. Jumping off preverbal non-fiction cliffs is never fun. It's like jumping from the snow to the hot tub.I'm not sure why people are shocked that you talk about sex either. You're a nice-looking guy on TV with boatloads of cash. Of course, you got laid. Of course, women throw themselves at you and OF COURSE you were emotionally unavailable. If I have learned anything from this book, was that you weren't lying when you said, in fact, that you WERE Chandler. But I get peoples points. I mean, we got the assignment that you were a horny TV star. And then we just kept on getting it. (7,7,7,7) Redundancy. She's a *****. we want to get a point across, but then, what's too much?As a fan of yours (comedy in general), I don't think it's ever a good idea to read too much about people you admire from afar. I will never know you, and you will never talk to me in my life, so this book is all I have to go by. Yes, you were selfish (you call yourself that several times), but one thing that surprised me most, is when you spoke on how you would trade the money and the fame with your friend living in the rent-controlled apartment living with Diabetes. Considering how much you spent on treatments, and literally paying people to help you get clean, you had resources most addicts will ever see a 1/8th of. While you say you're grateful in the book, and I know you're trying to get the point across that ""fame doesn't fix you"", there are millions of people that would give their left um, thing, to be in your shoes, with access to Switzerland, hot nurses and new teeth (I can't even afford one implant). There is a reality missing from this that doesn't quite touch the rent-controlled tenant. This is coming more from the side of over-celebrity that most of us will never even remotely see. That chasm is large, and your perspectives after thirty years of fame are so far on the side of Hollywood, that not having money seems better. (It's not. Money won't fix everything, but it eases burdens. Ask me what my husband and I argue most about.)The title of this book should be, ""The One Where the Grass is Always Greener.""Matthew. Write another book. I would love to see a comedic novel from you based loosely on your life. You would get to use the words ""based on a true story"". You CAN write, I saw that. And while you have spent your life chasing other people's opinions, and mine shouldn't matter, consider it. There is so much untapped creativity there that it makes me crazy. Be grateful you have the platform you do and you're not a mom stuck in the burbs like me. Oh, and call Craig, and maybe pay for his Diabetes medication.That's all I have. I thank you for opening yourself up and spilling the ugly out. That's never easy.

This book is raw. What he went through with drugs and alcohol was so incredibly difficult. But the other thing that really took me by surprise was how raw he is about his relationship with God.

Hope which has been crushed with this most recent news. And with that comes crushing sadness. Instead of hope, I just feel bad for him. All those hopes and dreams he had for himself, all that fighting, and for what? I have no doubt he has helped, and will continue to help, many people with his comedy, his words, his story.

30,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, 1)",4.5 Stars,Sandy Farmer,4,"One Sunday, I was visiting blogs, which I don't get to do very often, and stumbled upon one that caught my eye. I can't remember the exact wording, but the blogger stated they didn't enjoy a book that was getting a ton of buzz and love. However she worded her comments piqued my interest, so I looked up the book on Goodreads and decided almost instantly that it sounded like something I would like. I added it to my wish list, and Husband bought it for me for my birthday. I still put off reading it for a while because I needed to focus on review books first. I finally found time to pick it up, and I have to say that I didn't want to put Fourth Wing down. We never have lazy days where we just let the kids watch TV all day, but Husband wasn't feeling well, it was 101 degrees outside, and I was enthralled. So I read every chance I got that first day and read about 80% by midnight. I needed to sleep because I knew that was too much to finish at a reasonable time for me. And I finished the other 20% the next day.Fourth Wing has everything you could want from the first release in a new fantasy series. You have a flawed leading character--Violet is fragile. Her bones break easily, her joints and ligaments are weak as well. She is short. And generally not physically strong. She is, however, brilliantly intelligent. She spent her entire life training to go to the scribe quadrant. But her mother, one of the nation's top military leaders, decrees that Violet will enter the dragon rider's quadrant instead.The rider's quadrant is a vicious school of tests and challenges that will end with more cadets dead than alive. Often times the tests kill the cadets. Just as often, the other cadets will do the killing. And what deaths remain are likely from the dragons themselves! Unique schools like this are why series like Harry Potter, Vampire Academy, Divergent, Red Rising, and even Throne of Glass have been wildly popular and universally loved.And I mean dragons! The appeal of these mythological creatures is fascinating. Perhaps because they're imaginary, we love the different iterations of dragons throughout various literature and media. Fourth Wing's dragons are some of the best I've come across, from the varieties and their discerning qualities to their ability and willingness to bond to humans. Plus, the bond enables a psychic connection with their riders. These dragons are so well done. I applaud Rebecca Yarros for her imagination and vivid depictions in bringing them all to life.The friends are an interesting variety as well. There are friendships that form almost instantly, those that have spanned entire lifetimes, those that form unexpectedly, and even ones that form begrudgingly. The personalities differ as much as the dragons and the abilities they bestow upon their riders. Violet's older sister, Mira, warns her against forming friendships in the rider's quadrant. Allies are important, but friendship can often be a liability. Plus, when cadets are dying more frequently than surviving, forming friendships means saying goodbye to people who have shared pieces of their hearts with you and vice versa. But Violet doesn't survive the rider's quadrant by following the path others have established. She must survive by her own instincts and her own journey through the tests and trials.Speaking of abilities, Rebecca Yarros also did an excellent job creating a wide range of abilities since there are so many different characters. None of the signets were too similar to each other. And I loved the intrigue of wondering what new talent would be gifted to the next cadet. She even forms opposite sides of a coin without it appearing to be mirror talents.The enemies were fierce. We start off with Violet being warned by her sister Mira to steer clear of Xaden Riorson because he will kill her as soon as he gets the chance as revenge for what her mother did to his father in executing the king's justice for his father's rebellion. Violet meets him almost immediately. Nearly the same time, a brutal new cadet sets his sights on her as an easy target to weed out the weak links. Only Violet embarrasses the new cadet, and he swears revenge that he will kill her. And he's not the only person she ticks off during her first year. Xaden is hard to read. He forces Violet into his wing since he's a wingleader. He bounces back and forth between giving her advice that will help her survive, ignoring her completely, and sending others to her in ways that could be construed either for or against her.Of course, the driving questions are about whether Violet will survive each challenge she's faced with. If she does, will a dragon want to bond with her? At least until you get to a point where you have answers to these questions, and then you want to know what will happen next. I can't reveal those questions to you as they'd be spoilers.Favorite quotes:-""They choose for reasons they don't see fit to share with us."" He pushes off his desk. ""And not all strength is physical, Violet.""-You are not attracted to toxic men, I remind myself...I had to laugh at that one.-""One does not live a century without being well aware of the space one takes up.""-""Justice is not always merciful.""-""I know you just want to keep me safe,...,""I whisper. ""But keeping me safe is also keeping me from growing, too.""-""I will hate you for this."" ""Yeah."" He nods, a flash of pure regret crossing his face as he draws away. ""I can live with that.""-""Andarna is my favorite.""-""You can ride me when the flesh rots off my bones, wingleader.""-""Whatever you feel is natural. Allow yourself to feel it, but then let it go.""-""...if we let fear kill whatever this is between us, then we don't deserve it.""-""One generation to change the text. One generation to choose to teach that text. The next grows, and the lie becomes history.""I was so disheartened when I finished Fourth Wing and went to go purchase Iron Flame only to find that it wasn't released yet. The unique school setting where the cadets die more often than survive. The friends. The enemies. The romance. The DRAGONS. All of it was exactly what I look for in a series. Now, I will say that once the characters leave the setting of the school and undoubtedly have to face the corrupt government, things have the potential to go south like series such as Divergent and The Hunger Games. We shall see if The Empyrean series can survive the traps that other series before it fell into or will it thrive similar to series like Red Rising and Throne of Glass. That being said, Fourth Wing gets 4.5 Stars. Have you read Fourth Wing? What did you think? Let me know!",TRUE,23-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2023",1649374046
31,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, 1)",Amazing,Ryan Harris,5,"** Spoilers **Oh, my goodness this book is captivating! It had me hooked from the beginning!Let's get into it!Violet - Love her! She is super smart and figures things out quickly. She is witty and spunky. She loves and protects so many people. She makes so many friends along her journey and protects them ever chance she needs to. She finds friends from her past, Dain. (Which I'm sorry if you do like him, I didn't like him from the very beginning.) Then she finds, Rhiannon, Ridoc, Liam, Sawyer and more. Even with Jack, he was a total ass to her, crazy trying to kill her and she still felt bad that she killed him to protect her friend. She stays in her own lane and works hard to prove that she can be a rider. To prove to her mother and everyone else that she can and will. So, she conquers all of these challenges. She becomes a rider! Not only does she pair with one dragon but two! Tarin and Andarna! To add Tarin is mated to a dragon Sgaely which is Xaden's dragon! Connect Violet and Xaden even more than the automatic connection they already have. Let's talk about that! The one person she is told to stay away from is the ONE GUY she falls for!! Of course, kind of an enemies to lovers going on. Yay! I instantly love Xaden and Violet together. Even when she kept thinking he was going to kill her. I thought no way they're going to end up together or connected one way or another.Xaden - Total bad-boy vibes, of course. But hides his true feelings for Violet. Also, the fact that he took over the full responsibility of all the rebel children and had them in scripted into Basgiath to either prove loyalty becoming riders and fight for Navarre or die trying. Better than all of them being killer because their parent were rebels. He is a complete protector, he protected Violet every chance he was given but also hid it very well. I am annoyed that he had to be hiding some kind of secret! Why couldn't he just tell her everything?? I mean truly I get why he didn't but why? lol. Then this whole time he was hiding his true feelings from her. But then it comes out at the very end when he thinks she is going to die.Other side notes:Back to Dain for a bit. I don't like him. He is annoying and is always try to ""protect"" Violet but in a way that is whiny and trying to bring her down. His power is to see someone's memory. He secretly uses it on her to see what she knows about Xaden. Then he tattletales on them to his dad. Ugh. I. Don't. Like. Him.So, Violet gets two dragons. Andarna and Tarin is mated to Xaden's dragon Sgaely. That also makes it so Xaden and Violet can mind speak to each other. and Violet can also communicate with Sgaely. Then with both their signet powers they are one badass couple. Xaden (shadows), Violet (lightening). Also, how their dragons cannot be away from each other for more than 3 days. I am excited to see where this goes.Liam! I am so sad that we lost Liam. I cried so much when all of that happened. I was hoping so way that Violet could freeze time like she could with Adarna but I never did. Not only did she lose a great friend, but Xaden also lost a brother. It was so sad. I'm definitely going to miss his character.So, Xaden and some of the other rebels and dragon were working with gryphons and their fliers. Enemies of Navarre. They are giving them weapons to help fight the venin and wyvern. Violet is completely in the dark about this until the end of the book. These people she thought were a complete fantasy. Her father told her stories from a book, he leaves her a hidden letter in the book basically telling her that these people and creatures are real, and their government is hiding the truth from their people. Then at the very end of this book someone believed to be dead is actually ALIVE! He is part of the rebellion! I knew something happened at the end due to other people's reactions, but I never thought that, that would be it! definitely a good twist!I cannot wait for November when the 2nd book comes out!",TRUE,04-09-2023,"Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2023",1649374046

And her the brilliant plan she came up with for each of her sparring sessions made me jump up and down with joy.Xaden. I loved him the second he learned Violets name and threatened her life. The tension between them was instantaneous and it was always sizzling between them with every encounter. For them to have waited so long to cave in to their attraction was agonizing but so worth it. Though he's really put himself into a deep hole by the end of this book. I'm really really going to enjoy seeing him pull out all the bells and whistles to gain Violets trust again. I know it's going to be even more intense I bet.I honestly despise her mother. I cannot believe she is willing to risk another child, especially considering Violet had only been training for 6 months. All because of their name and image. I would have had a few choice words for her. And then later when Violet proved herself to her mother's standards? AND HER MOTHER IGNORED HER??? Hell no. No. No. No.Another person I hate? Dain. That spineless weasel, I can't stand him. I need to be Violets friend so I can punch him and break his nose, I swear. He's only out for himself. One minute he's lecturing Violet, telling her what to do, acting like she's not 20 years old, the next he's celebrating the exact thing he was scolding her about and acting like he was responsible for it. Just because he realized that he can be associated with her and her some fame from it or something. And his ""the rules say...."" oh just shove it, Dain.The amount of people after Violet in this book is insane and that girl has so much luck on her side.Also? I loved how many people died in this book. Do not get attached to many of these characters because they drop like flies.The dragons. THE DRAGONS!!! I freaking love them. Every single second a dragon is on these pages I'm in love. Especially Tarin - he's hilarious and I love his and Violets banter!The revolution happening is going to get crazy in the upcoming books. I'm not the biggest fan of those but I'll suffer through it to continue loving these characters.Now, the biggest spoiler because I need to remember for book 2. So, you know, don't read of you don't want spoilers...I CAN'T BELIEVE BRENNAN IS STILL ALIVE!!!!!!! How did he fake his death with his mother?? Does she know? Is her mother in the dark? How mad is Violet going to be?? Her father died from his death basically and Violet loved her father. Also? This is not going to go well with Xaden keeping this from her and HE BETTER TELL HER EVERY FREAKING SECRET IN HIS LIFE!!!!! If he messed up what they have forever and she moves on to someone else I'll never forgive him.So suffice to say, this book has me obsessed and I'm about to own 4 copies - at least! The hype is worth it. I'm telling everyone to read it. And I can't wait for more!",TRUE,25-08-2023,"Reviewed in the United States August 25, 2023",1649374046
34,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, 1)",Survival of the fittest on a whole other level,Scottishwolfdemon,5,"I am a reck after reading this book but in the best of ways. I cannot remember the last time I have been left this way after finishing a book to where I am not sure what to do next whether it is to pick up another book or soak in what I have just finished. I usually go with the former but this time I am probably going to do the later for a day or so. Rebecca Yarros has successfully put me in a temporary book coma. The world that Yarros builds is absolutely stunning and the structure of government and military is solid and makes sense. The characters she has created for this story‚Ä¶. Gah I feel like I could wright an essay on quite a few of them easily and that‚Äôs not just counting the main character Violet. But I do connect to her the most on a pretty deep level.That connection being having a sever disadvantage in a field that doesn‚Äôt do well with having just one. But she doesn‚Äôt let that stop her if anything it fuels her to prove everyone wrong. I have had to do that myself and really through this book I realized I kind of forgotten to do that here recently and was reminded of that part of my self. So I really admire Violet's tenacity, determination, and adaptably in every challenge she faces. But our main character is not the only one I have strong feelings for. Yarros has this spectacular ability to get you to almost feel something for most of these characters in this book no matter how long they are in the book, and boy will you feel some feelings while reading this. So for warning feelings will be had!As for the romance and spice I have to say yet again it has been a while since I have been on edge for a relationship development in a story, but again in the best of ways. I would say slow burn is not even an adequate description for them. While yes it takes a minute for our love interests to admit their feelings with each other, the build up to that point wasn‚Äôt a slow burn it was already an inferno really. Don‚Äôt know how many times I sat there fanning myself and it wasn‚Äôt even over a spicy scene. But another thing I have to appreciate is that the romance does not over take the main story that is being told. While the romance is to die for, other relationships that are built or building in this story also captivate you as well.Another thing about this book that I have to commemorate the author for as a critique is how she is able to get you to feel about movements and the structure of this world as well. You will feel wonder and awe along with sorrow, horror, and anger very easily as this world is developed and certain structures and systems are played out. She has artfully and skillfully found that perfect balance in getting the reader to feel for pretty much the whole entire story and every aspect of it. This is what I believe is what makes this such a great book to read. It is the fact that she does not get you to just feel for the characters in the story but she gets you to feel for everything in this story. I hope she is able to carry this through for the rest of the series because if she can then she has created something special for us and we better prepare to be recked some more for what is to come next.",TRUE,20-09-2023,"Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2023",1649374046
35,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, 1)",A certified page turner,Basil Argyros,5,"Rebecca Yarros has 'it' -- the gift of writing certifiable page-turners. I'm an old hand at fantasy literature, and I'm embarrassed to confess how often I robbed myself of sleep by reading 'one more chapter' in Fourth Wing past my usual bedtime. If she continues in this vein, her new series will be a commercial blockbuster. Kudos. It also qualifies as a crossover adult/YA series (more on this, later in the review).To step back and give it a critical evaluation -- for any fantasy novel or series, the first criteria is whether the world the author builds is interesting, and believable. The geography in Fourth Wing is pedestrian, but serviceable. The society adheres to the usual fantasy requirement of technological stagnation over a period of centuries. The culture in Fourth Wing, with its high level of literacy and the absence of plate armor, resembles Rome more than the usual 'medieval' setting, which is rather refreshing. Magic furnishes some quasi-modern amenities (e.g., 'mage lights' that illuminate interior rooms).The society is interesting. If Rebecca were toiling in the Star Trek novel fields, her 'Riders Quadrant' would make a nice analogue of Starfleet Academy -- in the Mirror Universe. Martial arts training is all full-contact, edged weapons included. Cadets in this elite institution routinely kill each other, with few repercussions.The human-dragon relationship is symbiotic. A human to whom a dragon chooses to bond will acquire special abilities, fueled by the dragon's magical nature. To use another Star Trek analogy, human and dragon are like Trill and symbiont -- while a dragon can survive the loss of its rider, a human, once bonded, cannot survive the death of its dragon.The aspect of the society that I most appreciated is the obvious 'secret' that the established ruling elites are ruthless bastards who carefully control the prevailing narratives to keep the masses in line and patriotic, while themselves are completely amoral. This is where Rebecca's fantasy world shines, with this resemblance to our contemporary world.The heroine, Violet, is an analogue of Rebecca herself. No fault there -- authors re-imagining themselves in their fiction has a long, and often successful, history. What makes Violet interesting is that Rebecca has replicated her own, very difficult medical challenges in her heroine. (This is surely the first work of fiction in which forms of the word 'subluxation' occur repeatedly.) I give her credit for this, for it makes Violet more interesting (I can't help but be reminded of Moorcook's Elric, whose physical weakness from his albinism is compensated for only by drugs, or the possession of Stormbringer).I have a few literary criticisms, none of which will detract from (indeed, they'll probable add to) the series' appeal. For example, applicants to the death factory that is the Riders Quadrant are almost puppy-dog eager to get in -- seemingly unoppressed by the reality that three-quarters of them (if I remember correctly) will die during training. They also look and talk like contemporary Zoomers. This is part of the YA appeal of the books, but it's a bit of a stretch to imagine contemporary Zoomers cheerfully signing up for such a place! The sex scenes are painstakingly detailed, with truly anatomic precision. For a YA audience, I suppose this might be useful information, but for an adult reader, they become tedious rather quickly.Congratulations, Rebecca. I look forward to receiving my pre-order of Flame Wing . . . :)",TRUE,31-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2023",1649374046
36,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, 1)",I can‚Äôt believe I waited so long to read this epic book,Heidi Dischler,5,"Guys. I‚Äôm not lying here: 2023 is MY YEAR for reading. I cannot tell you how many books I‚Äôve read that have been so astonishingly beautiful and amazing and overall top tier. This novel is no exception.Coming into this book, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. The only other book I‚Äôve read by Rebecca Yarros is The Things We Leave Unfinished. Also amazing, but if you‚Äôve read it you know it‚Äôs on a completely different playing field than this book. I mean, Fourth Wing is on a different world and isn‚Äôt a historical romance novel. It is epic, though, and I‚Äôm not using that word lightly.Fourth Wing is a fantasy novel set in the world of Navarre where dragons, griffins, and magic are real. If you‚Äôve followed a majority of my reviews on my blog, you know that I hardly ever review fantasy novels. I honestly think the only other fantasy novel I‚Äôve reviewed was The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, which honestly was a real world fantasy, so wasn‚Äôt that far outside of my realm. With that being said, this book is outside of my typical comfort zone but holy hell did I love it. Now I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôve been missing out on all of these amazing fantasy novels and I might just go on a binge.So, what exactly did I like about this novel? Everything. But to break it down: the world building that went into writing this is absolutely insane and makes it an amazing read in itself; the characters that don‚Äôt necessarily make you think ‚Äúoh this again‚Äù with the main heroine; the unbeatable plot; and the beautiful, comical writing style that Rebecca Yarros demonstrates.The world building speaks for itself, but the characters that don‚Äôt follow typical patterns particularly made me like this novel. For instance, our main heroine, Violet, is way weaker than other riders. She doesn‚Äôt fit the mould. While this is typical for our main character, what follows isn‚Äôt. Instead of her beating all odds and becoming the strongest rider of all, she basically just‚Ä¶ adjusts. She has to do things differently and doesn‚Äôt just become a natural born rider. It‚Äôs amazing and you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about if you‚Äôve read the book.The plot is just like what I said: unbeatable. You have foreshadowing, a romantic subplot, tension and high stakes throughout the entire novel, and man is it satisfying. I‚Äôm not sure how long this series is going to be, but I am here for it.Lastly, Rebecca Yarros‚Äô writing style in this novel is nothing short of spectacular. You get epic battle scenes, romantic moments that play with your heart, and comical snips that make you laugh out loud. It really does have everything and I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire novel.Overall, this review is huge but I had a lot to say. I honestly can‚Äôt even point to something that I disliked about this novel, which just goes to show you how much I loved it and how great I think it is. If you enjoy fantasy novels, you‚Äôll fall in love with this book. If you don‚Äôt enjoy fantasy novels? You‚Äôll still fall in love with this book. I‚Äôve already recommended it to my book club, my mom, and my brother. Y‚Äôall are welcome.Favorite quote: ‚ÄúAnd when others are quick to stand in front of me, Xaden always stands at my side, trusting me to hold my own.‚Äù",TRUE,06-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 6, 2023",1649374046
37,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, 1)","""We can live as cowards or die as riders.""",Reading with FeFe,5,"1st person/single pov (with end chapter from alternate pov)Spice: 3.5/5Welp - I get it now. All the hype surrounding this book had me not only excited to read it but nervous as well because I know from experience that some books have a big following but they don't always live up to my expectations once I read them. Yeah, not a single doubt about this one now. In fact, it surpassed what expectations I had before opening it. My husband even read it (and he doesn't read stuff like this at all lol) and loved every minute of it! He finished and ran straight to audible to preorder the second book before I could myself! üòÇThis is the first I've read from this author and I liked how the world-building was written to give you enough to completely picture their environment but not so much that it became boring or felt like it was added just to fill a chapter. The character development was phenomenal and drawn out at a pace that felt natural, never forced or rushed in order to get them where they needed to be for the end of the book. (Speaking of the end of the book - I'll definitely be coming back to that one later!) And there is spice... I don't know why but I wasn't expecting the spice that I got from it. Then I got to it and hellooooooo Shadow Daddy!!! ü§§ I assumed there would be some flirting and some fade to black stuff but nope - Rebecca gave us a full-on adult fantasy complete with tension, steam, and chemistry. Plus, it was the perfect amount. Not too much and not too little. ü§åüèªMy favorite thing though, besides the killer storyline going on here, is the little moments of humor and found family sprinkled throughout. I love it when I can laugh with the characters in a book even if chaos and/or danger is surrounding them. Humor and sarcasm are coping mechanisms for me so this not only had me engrossed in the story but it left me feeling like these characters were more alive than just words on a page.As for the ending... let me just say that I never saw it coming. I usually can spot the twists a mile away and I did in fact spot one of them but that wasn't the biggest one. It wasn't the bombshell dropped at the last possible minute that made waiting for the next book torture even though it will be here in like a week or so lol. I don't know how all of these people who read this when it came out haven't gone mad with the wait because it's only been days for me and I'm still trying not to scream over it anymore!So if you're about to jump into this one just buckle up. It's full of action, laughs, drama, secrets, suspense, passion, and so much more. Once you get to the last 20ish percent or so don't make any plans that will cause you to put this book down because you will wish you hadn't. I'm telling you I could not function like a normal adult until I finished it. I was angry, I was shocked, I bawled my eyes out (I mean why Rebecca? Just WHY?!), I swooned all over the place, and then my head exploded with six little words... ü§ØEnjoy!!!",TRUE,01-11-2023,"Reviewed in the United States November 1, 2023",1649374046

Yea, I said it. Yea, I totally mean it!We follow Violet, a woman with chronic illness, and her journey in war college where everyone is a target. There isn‚Äôt enough dragons for the amount of cadets accepted and there isn‚Äôt a rule against ‚Äúvoting people off the island‚Äù. We watch Violet grow from former scribe student to full on dragon riding badass with a group of close knit cadets and a love interest that either wants to kill her for past actions or help her become the warrior she is.I literally can not stop talking about this book. I am a sucker for great writing style and in depth description and Fourth Wing had it. This book is very much a love story, but if felt like a book about Navarre, its history, its laws, its war and there HAPPENS to be this influential love story of the most powerful riders of all time going on at the same time. I LOVED that! This book is so rich with this country‚Äôs history, dragon laws, and lore, you feel like a citizen of this fictional place.My favorite character was most definitely Violet. It‚Äôs been a hot minute since I read a true, from the get-go strong female character. She came out on the first few chapters holding a middle finger in the air to anyone who underestimated her. She didn‚Äôt stand her ground with just words, she acted upon it in multiple badass moments. We watch her grow stronger, work through her weaknesses, make her sacrifices, but also never lose her empathy. That empathy helped her find a group of friends that became her allies and helped her soar.Yarros‚Äô writing is absolutely stunning. She was able to keep a medium pace story going while also telling us about multiple locations and their people, dragons and their descriptions, battles, etc. It practically played cinematically in my mind. Yarros‚Äô words transport you to Basgiath War College and made you a side character that observed the life changing and world altering story of Violet Sorrengail. And that cliffhanger!!

39,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, 1)",Lords of Discipline + Dragonriders of Pern + ...steamy romance? But it works!,Greg Barlin,5,"I first came across Fourth Wing when I noticed it in the #1 position on Amazon's Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of 2023 So Far. But beyond that selection, I looked at how the reviews were trending. At the time, there were more than 21,000 reviews (it's now about to crest 40,000), and the average was a whopping 4.8 stars. It has to be good for that many people to love it, right? In need of a palate cleanser after the difficult read that was The Whispers, I decided I'd limit the likelihood of another clunker and see what all the hype is about. And I'm happy to say that I get why so many people love this book: it's pretty great.Fourth Wing is set at Basgiath War College in the mythical land of Navarre. It opens on Conscription Day, where thousands of twenty-year-olds assemble to take their place among the healers, scribes, or infantry. The most elite of them try to join the most selective branch and become dragon riders.Our heroine is Violet Sorrengail. Bookish and smart, yet frail, she always imagined a future as a scribe, just as her father had been. But her mother is a rider and a general in the army, and she has other ideas. Against Violet's wishes, her mother insists she attempt to be a rider as well. But this isn't an idle push in a different direction. The stakes are the highest possible for those trying to become riders: from the opening conscription challenge through bonding with a dragon, there are dozens of opportunities to fail, and any failure when attempting to become a rider equals death.In addition to the general peril of the tasks at hand, there is also a ruthlessness among the members of the War College. Fewer classmates means better opportunities to bond a dragon, and so the murder of fellow classmates, while perhaps not encouraged, is certainly allowed, making every waking moment one filled with potential death. Yarros creates an interesting caste within the college of students who carry ""rebellion relics"". They are the children of adults involved in a rebellious uprising six years prior. All of the adults were executed, and the children were only spared execution as well by being forced into conscription as riders. As a result, they all tend to possess a brooding darkness -- you could think of them as the ""Slytherin"" of Basgiath. To further complicate things for Violet, those children of the rebels all intensely hate her because Violet's mother was responsible for ordering their parents' execution.The novel is packed with a ton of genre-bending elements. There is the basic plot -- Violet's unlikely journey through her first year at Basgiath War College -- which stirred up memories of one of my all-time favorite books, Pat Conroy's The Lords of Discipline, based on Conroy's first year at The Citadel military college. There are dragons and dragon riders, which of course evokes memories of plenty of fantasy novels, with Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series top of mind. And then there's some romance, and a potential love triangle, which starts out feeling like something from a YA novel, but ends up a lot more R-rated and steamy, and more akin to what you might find in a novel with Fabio on the cover. Add to this a nuanced backstory and some misdirection on who the reader should trust and believe, and Fourth Wing truly has something for everyone.There is depth to the story and characters, which elevates the story and I'm sure plays a big role in the stellar reviews. Yarros handles relationships well, whether it's the strained relationship between Violet and her mother, the love between Violet and her sister, or the friendships Violet forges with her classmates. The romance is the romance; honestly I could have done without it, and while it was almost humorous at times, it works for what it is meant to be. Yarros also does a standout job of presenting how her characters handle loss. Whether it's grieving the loss of family members or their classmates, there is an undercurrent of sadness and longing that affects many of the characters and hardens them to the task at hand. Despite the intensity of their training, Yarros does a pretty good job reminding us that they're only in their early twenties and still figuring out a lot of life.I suspect a lot of the hype and enjoyment of the book is related to how Yarros turns a straightforward ""year 1 as a student story"" into something more. I can't help but compare that to the Harry Potter books (except, of course, Harry never had hot magical sex with Ginny Weasley -- at least not within the pages of any of the books!). Those novels changed significantly for me with the third book in the series, The Prisoner of Azkaban. Where books 1 and 2 were decent and straightforward YA novels, The Prisoner of Azkaban took the story to a more nuanced and mature level. Yarros does the same thing here, but all within the pages of a single book. I get why people are so drawn to the story.Overall, it's a winner. It's fun, and while it feels derivative of several other novels, it also combines those stories and plots in its own unique way. Book 2, Iron Flame, is already set for release this November (I've already ordered my copy!), and so if you fall in love with the characters, you'll have the opportunity to spend more time with them before long (well, at least with those who survive Fourth Wing). It's a compelling read and like the other 40,000+ readers who have this trending at almost 5 stars, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",TRUE,17-07-2023,"Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2023",1649374046
40,No Brainer (Diary of a Wimpy Kid Book 18),Best Book Ever - from a 10 year old,KMG,5,"I was very excited for this new book to come out. I am a HUGE fan of this series and have been reading it for years. I just finished reading it a few minutes ago (it came in mail yesterday afternoon) and I already am waiting to see what happens to Greg next. I have every single book in the whole series and I care about these characters a lot. I have read most of the books at least five times each.I like the series because Greg is funny and it's sort of funny how no matter what happens, he just rolls with his life. I don't really like that poor Greg never really has a ""happy"" ending. My mom says it's because the story is told from his perspective.In this book, the school is losing money because the kids are not getting good grades. This sounds crazy, but it can really happen! So, the school decided to give rewards to kids who got higher grades. The robot cleaner in the book reminded me of the grocery store robot in my town. It's cute with its big, googly eyes.Mom Says:Reading has always been a focus in our home. We believe in reading and education and being able to research things on our own. We are teaching this foundation to our children. I spent a couple hours each DAY reading to my kids when they were little. We read the entire Harry Potter series aloud to them in 2021, before bedtime for an hour each night.Reading has always been important.¬†My daughter was not a confident reader six years ago, when she was four and five years old.

She reads one or two books a day now. She reads chapter books, 200-page books with no pictures in them.

Every topic he chooses is brought to life no matter how many years have passed since the events took place. His writing is smooth and unobtrusive, describing the past in a matter-of-fact, approachable way. If history books had been like this in high school, we‚Äôd all have gone on to be scholars.Killers of the Flower Moon is an especially difficult book to read, not because of the writing but because the subject is so painful. Grann documents how literally hundreds of Osage were murdered for riches in the early 20th C. As American Indians, their lives were worth less than that of dogs. An entire corrupt and venal society was arrayed against them. Well aware they were systematically being murdered, they had no recourse. The authorities, both political and legal, were complicit in the murders. No one would help save them from systematic eradication.This is an excellent telling of a dark and shameful time in our history.

51,Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI,Riveting Account of Murders of Osage Indians to Steal Their Money,Linda,4,"Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann is a well documented tale of the murders of 20 plus Osage Indians to steal their money. It took place in the early 1920‚Äôs and became known as the Reign of Terror. The land the Osage Indians were forced to live on was some of the richest oil reserves in the country. The Osage sold off some of the land but retained the mineral rights, thus they owned the oil. At one time they were the richest per capita people in the world.The Federal Government determined the Indian was incompetent and created a guardianship situation where a white man was appointed to oversee the expenditures of the funds. In order to spend their own money for groceries or medicine or anything, the Indian had to meet with their guardian and get permission. When the killings began, two individuals were shot and their bodies left where they fell. The sheriff didn‚Äôt have any luck finding the killer. When a house blew up killing an Osage woman, her white husband, and a white maid, a group of Osage went to D.C. and appealed to the President to do something. The FBI was created to address the situation.It is a gripping story.

52,Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI,Couldn't Put I Down,Janice H. Kasten,5,"Killers of the Flower Moon is the true story of the numerous murders of members of the Osage Native American tribe during the early 1920s. It was referred to as the Reign of Terror. The Osage community was incredibly wealthy because the supposedly worthless land in Oklahoma to which they had been confined since 1870 was found to contain some of the largest oil reserves in the United States. People flocked there to strip them of their wealth by any means possible including murder. The situation was exacerbated by the government policy that claimed the Osage were not competent enough to manage their money and thus White guardians were assigned to each Osage native for that purpose. This of course resulted in the guardians stealing from and murdering their clients.The deaths began with several members of the Osage community wasting away. The local doctors attributed this to illness. It was not until two members of the Osage were shot and killed that it was acknowledged that there was a plot against the Osage community, but little was done to solve those murders. When the bombing of an Osage home resulted in the deaths of three people, a new investigative group under the Federal Government‚Äôs Justice Department was asked to look into the murders. That department had a new director, J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover assigned Tom White to the investigation. White was successful in finding the murderers and having them prosecuted.The book also discusses the life of Tom White who truly was an amazing man. The author is very critical of Hoover. Admittedly, Hoover was a man of massive ego but he did create an agency that developed the technical expertise and methods that allowed the solving of murders previously deemed unsolvable.I rated this book 5 stars for several reasons. It is an extremely compelling story; I could barely put it down. It was very well written; the author‚Äôs research into this Reign of Terror was immense. Nor did he did limit his investigation to this time frame. He also dug deep into the archives of Osage history to find unsolved or mysterious deaths that occurred both before and after the Reign of Terror. They were numerous. He estimated that the murders began in 1910 and continued through the early 1930‚Äôs. Lastly, it gave me an appreciation of the times in which I live. I am often very distressed about the changes occurring in society but when I compare it to that era‚Äôs rampant corruption and violence which was present throughout the whole of society, not just the Osage community, I cannot help but believe that we as a nation have become a more just and empathetic society.",TRUE,04-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 4, 2023",307742482
53,Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI,Highly Recommend!,Avonna,5,"KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI by David Grann is an enthralling true story of the murder, greed, and fear that permeated the Osage Indian tribe for years in 1920‚Äôs Oklahoma. This is an extensively researched look at the oil rich Osage and the prejudice which allowed white guardians to exploit the system to steal, embezzle, and murder their charges for their shares of oil rights and the newly formed FBI men who took on this murder investigation.Molly Burkhart watched as one by one her Osage family and friends were killed. Some by gunshot, some by poisoning, and others never designated with a method of death since the tribe became the richest people in the U.S. due to the oil under their land. In the 1920‚Äôs, the Osage were considered unable to handle their wealth and the Federal government decided that they should be appointed white guardians. When anyone questioned the deaths, they would mysteriously end up dead.The murder rate exceeded the national average when the government decided to send in men from the newly formed FBI under J. Edgar Hoover. At first, they did no better than the corrupt local law enforcement until Hoover sent in Tom White. He put together a team of his choosing who all entered the region undercover and soon began to piece together a conspiracy tied to the most influential rancher in the area.This book is intricately plotted not only making the characters come to life for the reader, but to show the Osage were set up to be exploited (hopefully) unintentionally by the Federal government‚Äôs decision that put the Osage under guardianship. The local white population took advantage of this system to follow the money and kill off family lines until the white guardians inherited the Osage money and oil rights. While this book focuses on the one conspiracy of criminals publicized in that time that were brought to trial after the FBI‚Äôs investigation, the author discusses many other murders that were never investigated. I was outraged by the prejudice, heartsick by the killing, and that is what I hope to feel and more when reading a book about a historical atrocity. The descendants of the Osage are still looking for justice and closure which will never come.I highly recommend this compelling historical true crime mystery.",TRUE,09-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 9, 2023",307742482

57,Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI,What is most disquieting about the crimes in Killers of the Flower Moon is the awesome extent of corruption that is revealed in,Gary Carden,5,"Killers of the Flower Moon by David GrannNew York: Doubleday$28.95 - 339 pages‚ÄúThe whites have bunched us up down here in the backwoods,the roughest part of the United States, thinking ‚Äòwe will drive theseIndians down to where there is a big pile of rock and put them therein that corner.‚Äô‚Äù Now that pile of rock has turned out to be worth millionsof dollars; now everybody wants to get in here and get some of the money.‚Äù --Osage Chief Bacon Rind.Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of David Grann‚Äôs Killers of the Flower Moon is the fact that despite the author‚Äôs painstaking research, and his marvelous use of period photographs and documents, this factual account of historic events attending ‚ÄúThe Osage Murders‚Äù contains the atmospheric suspense and tension that is normally associated with a classic murder mystery. In fact, Grann has written a murder mystery - One that asks who methodically killed hundreds of Osage Indians during a four-year reign of terror (1920-24). Osage history reveals the tragic details of how and why. Forced to move from Kansas to Oklahoma, the Osage tribe seemed to be destined to lives of abject poverty when they suddenly found itself catapulted into a world of excessive wealth. Oil is discovered on tribal land. Suddenly, every member of the tribe is potentially wealthy. In an attempt to control the chaos that ensued, the federal government created a document called a ‚Äúheadright‚Äù which gave each Osage household legal rights to the oil on their land. After a period of uncontrolled spending in which members of the Osage tribe acquired mansions and fleets of automobiles, the government attempted to control the excessive spending by establishing a ‚Äúguardian system‚Äù which assigned a ‚Äúlegal guardian‚Äù to each Osage family. This ‚Äúguardian‚Äù (usually a white banker, businessmen or ‚Äúcivic-minded citizen‚Äù was given the power to approve or deny all expenditures for the Osage tribal member (who had been judged to be ‚Äúincompetent‚Äù) by the government. The system was badly flawed, and many of the guardians used their position to embezzle huge sums of money. In time, the guardian documents became bargaining chips in investing in business ventures. Hundreds of guardians used their position as a means of acting as a ‚Äúmiddle-man‚Äù who would purchase items on behalf of Osage tribal members. The guardian would then sell the item to the Osage for an inflated price. For example, guardians could purchase automobiles on behalf of the Osage tribal member for $250 and then sell them to the Osage member that they represented for $2,500. As the wealth of the Osage grew, so did the schemes for exploiting the tribe. Hundreds of criminals were drawn to the region with schemes designed to acquire a portion of Osage wealth. Many of these new arrivals openly stated that they had come to Oklahoma ‚Äúto marry an Osage squaw.‚ÄùIt was a method that frequently succeeded. However, some of these opportunists sought a more direct method: murder. Author Grann‚Äôs research discovers one individual, William Hale who had arranged for the murder of 24 members of the Osage tribe. By soliciting the help of associates, Hale became one of the wealthiest men in Oklahoma. The astonishing catalogue of slaughter is carried out by men willing to resort to any means to accomplish Hale‚Äôs goal. Dozens of victims were poisoned with tainted moonshine and corrupt medical personnel performed autopsies that listed ‚Äúacute alcoholism‚Äù as the cause of death. Others were dispatched with a bullet to the back of the head or between the eyes and the victim‚Äôs body was found in his new car on a remote road. One family was killed by a dynamite blast that demolished their home. Often, Hale simply paid an assassin to kill a designated victim. Then, Hale would frequently hire a second assassin to kill the first. In those instances in which murderers were apprehended, Hale bribed juries and law officials and if all else failed, he simply paid another killer. Time and time again, government agents are assigned to investigate and in some instances, just as they uncover significant evidence, they are murdered and the evidence destroyed. One dedicated investigator called the FBI headquarters to report that he was on his way back with conclusive evidence against Hale. The next day his mutilated body is found near a railroad track. He had been murdered and thrown from the train. Another investigator‚Äôs body was found in another state, hundreds of miles away. What is most disquieting about the crimes in Killers of the Flower Moon is the awesome extent of corruption that is revealed in the book. State and government officials, medical personnel and lawyers - all are contaminated with the vice of greed. The corruption is so pervasive, the few moral and courageous individuals seem helplessly outnumbered. However, there are two remarkable people in this gruesome tale. One is Molly Burkhart, and Osage who survived the systematic murder of her family...murders in which her husband was implicated. Molly was diagnosed as a diabetic by two doctors who poisoned her insulin injections, in an attempt to slowly kill her. Molly survived and divorced her husband. The second remarkable character is Tom White, the FBI agent that pursued Hale until he brought him to justice. Much of the credit of for this amazing piece of investigative work went to the Director of the newly-created FBI agency, Hubert Hoover who turned out to be a man dedicated to his own self-interest. Through much of the investigation conducted by Tom White, Hoover managed to take credit for White‚Äôs courageous work. Jealous of any publicity directed toward agents other than himself, Hoover invariably succeeded in manipulating the factual data to his advantage. This is a remarkable work. Most noteworthy is Grann‚Äôs comprehensive account of the primitive nature of investigations in a time before forensics emerged. As a consequence, much of Tom White‚Äôs heroic pursuit of a villain who seemed to have the protection of most of Oklahoma‚Äôs judges, lawyers and public officials. However, Grann‚Äôs greatest achievement is the fact that he uncovers evidence that the total number of victims in the Osage murders exceeded the original 24 and possibly exceeded over 200.",TRUE,19-05-2017,"Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2017",307742482

59,Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI,"Another Largely Forgotten Piece of American History, Brought Back to Life",Bryan Carey,5,"American history is loaded with episodes of shame. A large percentage of our less memorable moments, as a nation, have been swept under the rug, kept out of classrooms, and largely forgotten as time progresses. But these events are real and all it takes is a skilled author to bring the lost history back to life. Such is the case with Killers of the Flower Moon.I did not know anything about these murders against the Osage until I read this book, so this was a definite eye- opener for me. I had heard of the Osage tribe, yes, but I did not know they fell into tremendous oil wealth and, subsequently, saw their members slowly dying off, either through gunfire or poisoning, as greedy individuals tried to get their hands on some easy cash. The book details several of the known killings and the cold, callous, calculated murders are chilling and puzzling. Chilling, because of the gruesomeness of the murders; puzzling, because of the nonchalant behavior of those who plotted the killings. Even when confronted with the murders, most of the guilty individuals seem to have no remorse at all. They don‚Äôt even perceive what they did as immoral in any way.This book reads like a mystery thriller, however it isn‚Äôt a page- turner, like some mystery genre books. You do start to make guesses as to who is responsible, but rather than get wound up in the who- done- it, the book grips you more for its educational aspects. You learn all sorts of things about the Oklahoma region that the Osage called home. You learn about the newly formed FBI and its role in solving the mystery. You learn about the problems of racism and the feelings of superiority that people felt against Indians. And you learn just how evil people can be when vast amounts of wealth are at stake.There are several surprises in this book, and one is the book‚Äôs final section. The book leads you to believe that the mystery has been solved and it sounds like everything is coming to a close. Then suddenly, the book continues for dozens more pages as the author tries to solve more of the mystery on his own, with the aid of local Osage tribe members. No one will ever know exactly how many people were killed during this reign of terror but I like how the author took it on himself to investigate and try to answer more questions.This book is another solid, educational wakeup call on the prevalence of racism and superiority that pervaded society in the past and is rearing its ugly head once again today. I like how the book includes pictures so that you can get to know the many characters involved. With so many names and so many people involved, it‚Äôs easy to lose track of who is who. The pictures help you put a face with the name. But the most important part of this book is its educational value.

I read this amazing book on Kindle and listened to it on Audible, as well. BTW the narrator on Audible, Zach Appelman, is really excellent. His ability to pronounce the French and German names, his articulation and his pregnant pauses really added to the reading of this book.Anthony Doerr‚Äôs book is simply stunning. Dazzling is a good word for it. I have reviewed many other books and have sometimes said this or that writer writes fluidly and well. I have given five stars to quite a few writers. ‚ÄúAll The Light We Cannot See‚Äù is a higher level of excellence that not many authors achieve. No wonder Anthony Doerr won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for fiction with this book!The chapters are short and beautifully written. I could say ‚Äúbeautifully and elegantly painted‚Äù; they remind me of a painting. This book is poetic, creative, imaginative and historically enlightening as well. Science and technology, it‚Äôs fascination and the power to help or harm, is explored along with the characters‚Äô thoughts and feelings; we learn about their courage or lack of and why they make their individual decisions during the rise of Hitler and on into World War II. The descriptions are incredibly sensitive and vivid. Objects are palpable; I could see and feel them. The book pulled me in so much that I was part of each scene. The poignant images remained with me and made the characters come alive.The author skillfully writes using a juxtaposition of events in the life of a blind French girl, Marie-Laure LeBlanc, and that of a German boy, Werner Pfennig. Towards the end of the book their lives meet.Marie-Laure, the blind French girl, lives with her father in Paris. She became blind at 6 years old due to congenital cataracts. She has developed her other senses, namely, hearing, touch and smell to compensate for her loss of sight. In her imagination, she can see colors when she uses her other senses to explore her world. Her father carves wooden replicas of all the buildings in Paris for her to learn to find her way home by herself. He is a very devoted and loving father and teaches her independence but promises her he will always be there for her and will never leave her. He is the master locksmith at the Museum of Natural History. Marie-Laure, who is a curious and bright child, goes with him to work and studies paleontology, archeology, geology and other branches of science with Dr. Gefford, while her father works.The boy, Werner, lives in an orphanage, ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs House‚Äù in Zollverein, Germany. The children in the orphanage are very close to starving. A good deal of the population is very poor and not getting enough to eat. When Hitler comes to power, the economy improves dramatically. People are getting more food (meat even) and new appliances. The German population is inundated with radio propaganda. Only state supported German radio channels are allowed. The German population is brainwashed. The people think Hitler is helping them climb out of poverty, build a better society and take pride in their Country again.Yet the future looks bleak to Werner. Nazi officials tell the boys in the orphanage that they will all have to work in the coalmines when they turn 15 years of age. Werner‚Äôs father had died in the coal mines, and Werner is not happy with the prospect of being underground in the dark pit of the mines. After finding a broken radio in the city trash, Werner gets it working. His fascination with radios and his skill in fixing them gives him a chance to escape the coal mines and go to paramilitary school. He has a chance to pursue his interest in radio technology and contribute to the new Germany. He visualizes a glorious future. In the attic at the orphanage, Werner and his sister Jutta had listened to foreign radio stations that were illegal under Nazi rule. A French radio station with science lectures fascinated them. How magical it was to hear a voice from afar, transmitted through the air! Jutta liked a program on magnets. Werner liked the program on light. ‚ÄúWhat do we call visible light? We call it color. But the electromagnetic spectrum runs to zero in one direction and infinity in the other, so really children, mathematically, all of light is invisible.‚Äù The radio was a symbol of freedom for them both, the freedom to learn and dream.Before he leaves for school, however, Werner smashes the radio. He does not want anything to interfere with his chance for what he thinks will be a better life. Listening to foreign radio stations is illegal and dangerous. Jutta, a free spirit with a strong moral compass, feels betrayed. She thinks her brother is turning into a cold, brutal Nazi like Hans and Herribert, two older boys in the orphanage who have joined the brown-shirted Hitler Youth. She insists that the broadcasts from the foreign radio stations say the Germans are committing atrocities, just the opposite of what they hear on the state-owned German stations.Werner gets caught up with his study of radios and blocks out the brutality around him at school. Despite his lack of courage to go against the dictates of his German superiors, the reader can see his conflict and the goodness in him that he wants to embrace. His friend, Frederick, a bird-lover and dreamer, is called the ‚Äúweakest‚Äù by the field commander but shows his courage by refusing to participate in the brutal death of a prisoner. Frederick pays for it by being beaten so badly that he becomes no more than a living vegetable.With the invasion of Paris in 1940, Marie-Laure and her father escape to Saint-Malo on the Brittany coast and find refuge with Marie-Laure‚Äôs great uncle, Etienne. Again her father observes and measures the buildings of this new city and carves a wooden replica of all 865 buildings. Unfortunately, his efforts cause suspicion, and he is arrested on his way back to Paris on an errand for the Museum of Natural History. He is convicted of ‚Äútheft and conspiracy‚Äù and sent to a prison in Germany. Feeling abandoned but gathering her inner strength, Marie-Laure continues to live with her great uncle, Etienne, and his housekeeper Madame Manec. Madame Manec starts working for the French Resistance and Marie-Laure takes over some of her activities when the housekeeper becomes ill. Upon Madame Manec‚Äôs death from pneumonia, Etienne gets his courage up and joins the French Resistance.Werner finds himself caught up in the brutality with no way to escape. His skill in detecting enemy radio transmissions results in many deaths, some of them innocent civilians. He is haunted by the deaths, especially that of one little girl in Vienna who reminded him of his sister, Jutta. Werner is sent to Saint-Malo to find the source of the radio transmissions of the French Resistance. He finds Marie-Laure‚Äôs broadcasts, but does not expose her. He recognizes the radio programs that had inspired him so much as a child. When he hears her voice saying that someone is in her house and is going to kill her, he vows to save her if he can reach her in time. Werner finds her and saves her life. The Americans are bombing the town, but during a lull, he helps her escape Saint-Malo.Intertwined with the lives of our two main characters, Marie-Laure and Werner, fairytale and reality collide. The legend of the ‚ÄúSea of Flames‚Äù, a 133 carat diamond said to be the intended gift of the Goddess of the Earth to the God of the Sea, parallels the calamities the characters experience in their lives. It was said that the person who had the diamond would live forever, but those he loved around him would die. If the stone were returned to the sea, the curse would be lifted. Especially during the bombing of Saint-Malo, Marie-Laure and Werner both draw parallels to their own predicaments and Jules Verne‚Äôs ‚ÄúTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea‚Äù. Trapped in the basement of the Hotel of Bees in Saint-Malo, Werner listens to Marie-Laure‚Äôs broadcasts of the science programs and music that had been recorded by her deceased grandfather. He thinks of Captain Nemo being trapped under the sea in the Nautilus. Werner and his fellow German soldier, Volkheimer, have run out of food and water and have very little air. ‚ÄúWho could possibly calculate the minimum time required for us to get out? Might we not be asphyxiated before the Nautilus could surface?‚Äù Are more monsters awaiting them when they do surface?Marie-Laure is trapped in her uncle Etienne‚Äôs secret attic room where he had broadcast codes for the French Resistance. Down below is an intruder, the Nazi Sergeant Major von Rumpel. He is there to find the ‚ÄúSea of Flames‚Äù diamond, which her father hid in the wooden house replica of her great uncle‚Äôs house. Instead of giving it to the Reich for Hitler‚Äôs dream museum in Linz, Austria, he wants to have the enchanted diamond to cure his cancerous tumor. He is dying, and he believes the diamond will save his life. Marie-Laure has not had food for two days and has had no water for one and a half days. She starts to think maybe this Nazi will spare her life if she gives him the diamond. Maybe the curse would end and her father would come back. Not trusting her safety, however, she has a knife handy. She thinks of Captain Nemo when he said to Ned Land, the Canadian harpooner, ‚ÄúBut let me tell you that if we‚Äôre caught, I‚Äôm going to defend myself, even if I die doing it‚Äù.There are many levels to this book and much to think about. The reader can get many insights into the human condition and why someone like Hitler could take over Germany and spread his sickness into so many other countries. The book is well researched and taught me a good deal about how it was to grow up in Germany when Hitler came to power. Additionally, I could understand more concretely how it was for the French when France was invaded by Hitler's armies. Good historical fiction brings all these events to life.

I do want to mention that I‚Äôm not a fan of some of the classics. A reader needs patience to trudge through pages of description. I‚Äôve tried The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas and Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. Maybe I‚Äôm just not that intelligent to appreciate and distinguish fine prose. Whatever the reason, this may give you an idea as to whether or not you want to continue reading.That said I feel like Doerr‚Äôs novel falls into a classics category‚Äîfull of description. I really wanted to love this book. It‚Äôs safe to say I wasn‚Äôt the audience he had in mind when writing it, and I'm in the minority of disliking it. As much as I adore his descriptions, I equally dislike his writing style. It‚Äôs as if he sacrificed characters for beautiful prose. The amount of descriptions, tangents, lists, and short chapters swallow up the characters. If I can‚Äôt connect with them, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to like the book. This book is roughly 530 pages long. It really should have been half its length.Point of ViewFirst, the book is told in third person omniscient, meaning the narrator knows all the thoughts and feelings of the characters. The narrator isn‚Äôt a character nor does the narration come from a character‚Äôs perspective. It‚Äôs some unknown person telling me all about the thoughts and feelings of the personas. I can‚Äôt recall reading a book with this POV, but I don‚Äôt like it. Eleven percent into the book, my frustration got the best of me. The POV and descriptions muddled my experience. There were passages where I couldn‚Äôt figure out if it was the character‚Äôs thoughts or feelings or the narrator‚Äôs.‚ÄúBlock out giant Frank Volkheimer with his mammoth boots and cinder-block jaw. Block out the little aristocratic professor pacing in front of the hearth and the late hour and the dogs and the shelves brimming with interesting things. There is only this.‚Äù When reading this passage, it sounded as if Werner was talking to himself. But he couldn‚Äôt be since it‚Äôs in third person.‚ÄúThe first policeman snaps flesh off his apple with his teeth. Are they looking at her?‚Äù Uh, she‚Äôs blind. The narrator is telling me what the police are doing, and then jumps into Marie-Laure‚Äôs head. At first, I thought Marie-Laure was describing the policeman and then wondering if they were looking at her. This wouldn‚Äôt work either, because if she doesn‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre looking at her, she wouldn‚Äôt know what the policeman is doing.ProseThere were images in the book where I couldn‚Äôt picture it. Maybe I‚Äôm dense, but it just didn‚Äôt sound right. This might seem nitpicky, however Doerr is praised for his prose‚Äîprose that took ten-years to write. I‚Äôll share a few examples with you.‚Äú‚Ä¶and she thinks she can smell threads of dust cascading from the ceiling.‚Äù Two issues with this description, 1) how does one smell threads of dust? And 2) how does a girl who goes blind at the age of six ‚Äòthink‚Äô she smells threads of dust?‚ÄúIn the gloaming to the east, he can make out a gray line of traffic herded between the edges of the road.‚Äù Gloaming? I had to look that up, which means twilight, dusk. Okay, it‚Äôs not his fault my vocabulary is limited, but it made me think if gloam has more power than twilight. Gloam is something I can see in a poem. Why not just say, ‚ÄúThe twilight in the east revealed a gray line of traffic herded between the edges of the road.‚Äù?‚ÄúThe eggs taste like clouds. Like spun gold.‚Äù Huh? This is such a weird comparison. How do clouds taste, and if I‚Äôve ever tasted them, they sure as heck wouldn‚Äôt taste like eggs. Or spun gold, which I would never eat unless someone wanted to steal it from me.ListsDoerr‚Äôs writing also consists of lists throughout the book. I call the separate words or phrases placed one after the other as lists. He‚Äôs a natural born list maker, which drove me nuts and came off as page fillers.‚ÄúLight, electricity, ether. Space, time, mass. Heinrich Hertz‚Äôs Principles of Mechanics. Heissmeyers famous schools. Code breaking, rocket propulsion, all the latest.‚Äù‚ÄúMarie-Laure wakes to church bells: two three four five.‚Äù He does this too much in the book that it lost its flair. ‚ÄúWind: immediate, bright, sweet, briny, luminous.‚ÄùAlong with the lists, Doerr also counts. ‚ÄúShe wakes to Madame Manec‚Äôs blocky pumps climbing to the third floor the fourth the fifth.‚Äù No punctuation, and continues the counting. ‚ÄúHer heart beats two four six eight.‚Äù Counting doesn‚Äôt build intrigue, so why have it?‚ÄúStatic static static static static. In his functioning ear, in the radio, in the air.‚Äù GAH!!!TangentsThen there are tangents. Many times the narrator tells us the characters are recalling memories when Doerr should have put more time into the moment. He‚Äôll start a chapter about a character, the character starts thinking about the past, and then the chapter ends.CharactersDoerr spent plenty of time giving me a visualization of the places, yet he fell short of showing me the characters. Also, the abundance of small chapters create long gaps between characters. For instance, Chapter 79 talks about Von Rumple‚Äôs diagnosis, and if I'm not mistaken, the next mention of him is Chapter 92.To top it off, in regards to Marie-Laure, the narrator tells me ‚Äúshe thinks‚Äù or ‚Äúshe feels‚Äù instead of showing me what she thought, or what she felt, and sometimes it being impossible. When talking about Marie-Laure, the author should have applied the senses using his beautiful prose. She‚Äôs blind, so use her touch, smell, taste to understand where she is or how she came to an assumption. Instead, Doerr uses the narrator. Below are a few I‚Äôve chosen:‚ÄúAt the top, she stands; she has the sense of a long slope-walled space pressed beneath the gable of the roof.‚Äù How does she ‚Äúsense‚Äù this without touch? The author describes so many things indepth and then just states how she senses it. She has needed her father to make a replica of the town, which she memorized over the years, yet she can ‚Äúsense‚Äù this area.‚Äú‚Ä¶but Marie-Laure is certain that when they stopped to greet a woman on the way here, Madame dropped off one envelope and picked up another.‚Äù The girl is blind. Did she hear the rustling of paper? A handshake? ‚Äú‚Ä¶Marie-Laure heard the rustling of paper when they stopped to greet a woman on the way here, a slight snigger escaped their lips before they moved on.‚Äù‚ÄúInsects drone: wasps, hoverlies, a passing dragonfly‚ÄîEtienne has taught Marie-Laure to distinguish each by its sound.‚Äù Etienne hasn‚Äôt been out of the house in about twenty-years and Marie only goes to certain places. How is it that he taught her how to distinguish between these sounds.These additional descriptions are some issues I had with other characters.‚ÄúYour problem, Werner,‚Äù says Frederick, ‚Äúis that you still believe you own your life.‚Äù This couldn‚Äôt be farther from the truth. Werner never acted as if he owned his life. Frederick did. Frederick continued to be himself. He stood up and refused to pour cold water on a prisoner. The women in town who transferred information to one another had more guts than Werner.In the chapter, Diagnosis, the author throws in a little bit about the medical exam while the rest of the chapter is about finding jewels. Doerr has the characters reflect on other things instead of describing the moment.There‚Äôs a passage where Werner sneaks away to see Frederick in the infirmary. He‚Äôs talking to a nurse, and then out of the blue comes, ‚ÄúEach time he blinks, he sees the men of his childhood, laid-off miners drifting through back alleys, men with hooks for fingers and vacuums for eyes; he sees Bastian standing over a smoking river, snow falling all around him.‚Äù Again, the author takes us into a reflection without really describing the moment. I also couldn‚Äôt make the connection between the conversation and his thoughts of the past.The past thoughts with the short chapters and flip-flopping from one character to another, prevented me from having an emotional connection. I didn‚Äôt care about them except for Frederick. When Werner died, I didn‚Äôt feel sorry for him or cry, which shocked me since I cry just watching a Hallmark movie.Due to all of these issues, I gave this book a 2 star rating.",TRUE,20-01-2016,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2016",1501173219

That was my daughter when she came downstairs the morning I finished this book to find me sitting on the couch clutching it on my lap. I can't remember the last time I read something that affected me in this powerful a way.The spiral construction of the plot reminded me of a symphony, with stories that initially seem disparate but then you start to recognize patterns and see how the parts fit together and long before the end you are marveling at the brilliance of how the author can have conceived of it all. And just as impactful was the exquisite, poetic language and how Doerr describes the most ordinary details of life in a way that makes you realize how beautiful those things you normally don't even notice are.I think what made me cry when I finished it was something that happened near the end which I won't go into so as not to spoil it for anyone, the way characters in the story retain their decency and humanity in the midst of the horrors of war, and most of all the fact that it was over and I wouldn't be able to keep reading it any more.",TRUE,03-11-2023,"Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2023",1501173219
63,All the Light We Cannot See: A Novel,See the Light through Superb Writing with Profound Lessons,Booksalottle,5,"Being the recipient of the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, my expectations for 'All the Light we Cannot See' were extremely high. With all things considered, I feel confident in saying that the critical acclaim was warranted and deserved in this case. Despite two minor annoyances, which I cover at the end, 'All the Light we Cannot See' is a phenomenally written, percipient, and remarkable example of sound literature.Author Anthony Doerr tells the story of how 18 years old Werner, a geeky, crafty, and thoughtful engineering prodigy in Germany, meets 16 years old Marie-Laure, a sweet, astute, and affable blind French girl during the siege of Saint-Malo in 1944. WWII, with all its stentorian and fervid trappings of war is the backdrop to Werner and Marie-Laure's fateful encounter. Written in short but vividly described, intricately woven chapters, the backstory of how they are brought together is told over the course of ten years starting in 1944 and flashing back as far as 1934. Through alternating timelines from both their perspectives, they meet and thereafter, the aftermath and implications of the encounter is written about up until the year 2014.Several pages into the novel, I knew I had a special literary piece in my hands. Werner and Marie-Laure are easy to fall in love with as Doerr writes them in a way that is honest and open. They are both multi-faceted in their strengths and their vulnerabilities, without either one playing a victim. Or at least, I never saw either one as a victim. I also appreciated that foibles, frailty, and other unsavory personality traits are depicted for both, allowing them to be alive with authenticity. I never want to read about characters who are too perfect and give the sun, the moon, and the stars all of the time. In the case of this novel, the two main protagonists are realistic for their time and for the circumstances they find themselves in. Joining Werner and Marie-Laure is a dynamic, and at times unfortunate mix of supporting characters who collectively illuminate the radiance and light of when humanity is good and kind. Juxtaposed, others in the mix depict the ugly darkness of when humanity resorts to selfishness and evil. Though they are fictional, we should all be so lucky as to encounter characters like Frederick, Madame Manec, Frau Elena, and Dr. Geffard, and hope the world breeds less of Dr. Hauptmann, Bastian, and Reinhold von Rumpel.'All the Light we Cannot See' has many lessons to impart on the reader, with one of the most profound being the titular Light that we must all see. The novel soundly shows us how those who are blind in the literal sense, can see more than those who have the ability to gaze as far as their eyes will carry. Additionally, the novel allows the reader to see for themselves how people whose visions are symbolically foggy, can still find goodness of heart and lightness of mind in unlikely places, and in the unlikeliest of people. Thought-provokingly, Doerr weaves for the reader how darkness creeps and consumes those who choose to be figuratively blind and who later become disillusioned by their own rancor, malevolence, and enmity. In the heart of strong-willed characters, we see how love, patience, understanding and empathy become the key that open and illuminate the path into light.I very much enjoyed this read, and surprisingly, the short chapters were not an annoyance as can sometimes be when the author is not skilled enough to execute them. Doerr is skilled and in the case of 'All the Light we Cannot See,' he, in what was in many instances only a page and a half, or even only half a page, has written cohesive chapters that are richly dense, brimming with cerebral atmosphere that envelopes the reader at the turn of every page. In this regard, I could see Marie-Laure's loneliness, and Werner's moral conflict. I felt the fear and uncertainty in Jutta, Daniel LeBlanc, and Etienne's reticence. I could taste the saltiness in the breeze that wafted over Saint-Malo, while also I could smell the acrid, grey, and gritty skies of Zollverein. Each time a character was famished due to scant war rations, I tasted the sweetness of the cool water they drank and I could taste the crust and crumb of the loaf of bread they tore apart. These are not things easy to achieve in books. Doerr however has done so fantastically.It goes without saying that there is plenty beauty and radiance to be found in 'All the Light we Cannot See.' Some of it emanates directly from the characters, while other times, it comes from the reader's own willingness to be open-minded. Taking that into mind, there were only two minor concerns I had with the novel. First being that when the author went into descriptive details of radio repair and engineering principles, my eyes would on occasion glaze over a bit since neither subject matter are strengths of mine. Nevertheless, as a curious reader, I know that it was necessary for me and other readers to know Werner's technical acumen when the author painstakingly described the workings of transmitters, transceivers, and the intricacies of repairing electronics.The second minor concern I had with the novel was the very last chapter, which covered the year 2014. So that I don't inadvertently give spoilers, I will simply say that I would have liked this chapter better if it was written differently. I loved the significance of it and the observations made, but I would have liked it better minus the game playing grandson. Also, I would have preferred the scene take place during a final visit to Saint-Malo rather than where the scene is depicted. Even better would have been if this very last chapter had been cut altogether. Ending the novel on the previous chapter labeled ""Frederick,"" would have had a better impact in my view.Despite the minor misstep in the last chapter, 'All the Light we Cannot See' is superb all around and I absolutely recommend it. I also want to point out that unlike some readers, the back and forth narrative depicting differing timelines and differing character perspectives did NOT bother me one bit. This is a technique that I appreciate and think it is one of the reasons why this novel is so special. Readers who complain about this non-linear technique must challenge their ability (or lack of it) to retain multiple levels of story details as the plot progresses. For serious readers who like their books to have weighty, loaded implications, and for readers who appreciate intelligent writing that give literary gifts every turn of the page, 'All the Light we Cannot See' is for you. Read carefully and ""open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever."" 5 Stars!",TRUE,17-08-2018,"Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2018",1501173219
64,All the Light We Cannot See: A Novel,Brilliant Historical Fiction,Debbie,5,"All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr has been discussed so many times on social media, I'm not sure I can add or say anything more that hasn't already been said. I thought the book was different and exceptional, and I can fully understand how it won a Pulitzer Prize. From the story itself, to the characters contained within, I thought it was brilliant. I know several readers did not like the constant change in time-line, but for me, it left me in suspense and turning the pages. For those who haven't read it, it's the story of a 16 year old blind girl named Marie-Laure and Werner, a young German boy and their perspectives and experiences in France during WWII. I have read a lot of wonderful fiction centering around WWII, but this book is unique in its storytelling and writing. I have to say for several days I found myself unable to begin another book. I just didn't want to let go of the characters. I can't say I was completely happy with the ending, but such is life. All I did was bend my spouse's ear for days about the book. I think he was happy when I finally moved on. To care about a book that much says a lot about the writing.",TRUE,14-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2023",1501173219
65,All the Light We Cannot See: A Novel,An intimate retelling of a story you think you know!,MomLovesYA,5,"Right away we meet ‚ÄúThe Girl‚Äù- 16 year old Marie-Laure LeBlanc who grew up in Paris and lost her sight at the age of 6. She is the only daughter of a widowed father, Daniel LeBlanc who works at the Museum of Natural History as the locksmith prior to the German occupation of Paris. And we meet ‚ÄúThe Boy‚Äù- 18 year old German Private Werner Pfennig who grew up in Zollverein, a coal mining town 300 miles northeast of Paris. We are alongside adolescent Werner and his younger sister, Jutta, when they find a crude radio which he begins to dissemble and assemble because ‚Äúnothing he‚Äôs encountered before has made so much sense‚Äù. The Reich learns of his aptitude with electronics and invites him, at 14, to attend Jungmanner, a military training camp for the best and brightest where he is instructed to ‚Äú. . . eat country and breathe nation.‚Äù He is described as ‚Äúthis snowy haired dreamer plucked out of the soot‚Äù.The author uses alternating chapters to reveal the back story of each character and to bring each character eventually to the walled city of Saint-Malo. In one story, the Germans occupy Paris so Marie-Laure journeys with her father as a last resort, to stay with her great uncle Etienne in a house, Number 4 rue Vauborel, which is also richly detailed. In our parallel story, the boy, Werner is currently stationed at the Hotel of Bees, Saint-Malo, as an electronics expert monitoring the airwaves listening for planes.Present day in this novel is two months after D-Day with half of western France free from German occupation. Saint-Malo however is the last citadel for the Germans and residents fear there may be a thousand or more Germans ready to die for their cause. Four years of occupation and now, a real sense of urgency. The author describes leaflets dropped by planes to warn residents to find shelter or leave before an impending airstrike. Marie-Laure's father is being held somewhere though and she decides to wait for his return. The bombers plan to cross the channel at midnight. Those chapters describing the present, ratchet the growing concern of the citizens of Saint-Malo as the reader meets many of the neighbors and townspeople who become real citizens of action. We learn of past broadcasts from the radio tower with its ingenious cabling as we listen in on present day broadcasts- the reading of Jules Verne's ‚Äú20,000 Leagues Under the Sea‚Äù.Werner waits in the basement of Hotel Bees monitoring the radio. Marie-Laure waits for her father‚Äôs return in her third floor bedroom with two tin buckets filled to the brim with water and the bathtub on the floor below filled as well (in recent months there have been instances of water shortages).There is also a rare, 133 carat blue, priceless diamond, ‚ÄúThe Sea of Flames‚Äù and a perfectly scaled model of each structure and street on Saint-Malo.The NY Times review had this to say about Werner. ‚ÄúAs the words of his teachers fight the power of his memories, an inner voice tells him, 'Open your eyes and see what you can see with them before they close forever.‚Äù This resonates so strongly with the reader because in our parallel story, Marie-Laure navigates by touch and then by memory.Throughout the story powerful images resonate- night-time readings over the radio, John James Audubon sketches, canned peaches, barnacles, a boiling frog. How does it happen that Werner ‚Äúwhen he opens his hand, there is a little iron key in his palm.‚Äù?So, who should read this book?This book is perfect for readers who love Geography. The place itself is fascinating; the reader can see in pictures of the walled city of Saint-Malo a natural isolation brought on by the tides. This was ‚Äúthe brightest jewel of the emerald coast of Brittany, France‚Äù prior to the German occupation and it's easy to see why they continue to hold on to it.This book is perfect for readers who love Historical fiction. The pivotal event of the story is well documented. The book provides an insider perspective to the events of the day, eyes on the ground so to speak through the observations and movements of Werner combined with those of the Whelk and the Blade. The book has been criticized for glossing over the hardships of war. I‚Äôm not sure I agree; the wartime hardships here are intimate, personal.This book is perfect for readers who love familiar literature drawing parallels or individual observations about ‚ÄúTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea‚Äù and the fate of Captain Nemo.This book is also for readers who like to read aloud; some of the chapters are short like diary entries and the novel is presented in an extremely readable format.What does the title mean?The first thing that comes to my mind when I think ‚ÄúAll the Light We Cannot See‚Äù is Marie-Laure‚Äôs inherent hope and optimism. She waits for her father, she ventures out, she takes action, she lives her life in spite of her handicap. She encourages this feeling in those close to her. For me, this light expands beyond Marie-Laure to include the good in her uncle, neighbors, friends, Werner, Jutta. We read of small and large acts of courage, of defiance, of hope.The light in the title is also a topic Werner hears discussed on a late 1930s radio broadcast about the brain‚Äôs power to create light in darkness (coal mines, blackouts, blindness). The phrase ‚Äúopen your eyes and see‚Äù pops up in several different places in the novel. Conversely the author writes, ‚Äúto shut your eyes is to guess nothing of blindness‚Äù.And if ‚Äúlight‚Äù is truth, there are many examples where we are confronted by lies- the letter from Marie-Laure‚Äôs father, the letter from Werner to Jutta, and where characters decide to hide the real truth or not to interpret it correctly.Notable Quotes:‚ÄúOpen your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever‚Äù (pages 48-49).‚ÄúThere are, he assures her, no such thing as curses. There is luck, maybe, bad or good. A slight inclination of each day towards success or failure. But no curses.‚Äù‚ÄúIs it right to do something only because everyone else is doing it?‚Äù, Jutta.‚ÄúThere must be order. . . The entropy of a closed system never decreases. Every process must by law decay.‚Äù (page 240).‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to be alive before you die?‚Äù, Madame Manac (page 270).‚ÄúOffering a loom on which to spin his dreams.‚Äù (page 389).‚ÄúI wake up and live my life‚Äù, Marie-Laure (page 468).",TRUE,23-03-2015,"Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2015",1501173219
66,All the Light We Cannot See: A Novel,Carried Away to Another World,Sharelle Moranville,5,"(Warning: contains spoilers)Anthony Doerr‚Äôs 2014 novel All the Light We Cannot See is a story of survival, courage, sacrifice, suffering, family, friendship, love, hope, and survival. It‚Äôs set in France and Germany during WW II.How many thousands of novels does that thumbnail description fit? (Jaded publishers and others in the business are starting to think of such novels as just another WW II book, which might account for some of the tepid reviews the novel got before it circulated through the wider reading community.)All the Light We Cannot See is one of the richest, most readable, discussable, and likeable WW II novels ever. Yes. Likeable. A narrative of war and suffering and death becomes a hopeful hymn about family, kindness, potential, magic, love, and mystery.Doerr brilliantly shows us the specifics in the general: the character so unique and real that the reader can become the character. And thus we can truly cloak ourselves in the potential for individual goodness in the storm of a world gone mad. We learn and are comforted by how we might behave in a similar situation.In the final analysis, the story belongs to Marie-Laure, the little blind girl with the father who keeps thousands of keys for the National Museum of Natural History and is a gifted woodcarver. In both Paris and Saint-Malo he carves tiny, clever models of their neighborhoods, which Marie-Laure must memorize with her fingertips. Then by counting grates, benches, streets, and tapping her other senses for cues, she must show him she can navigate their neighborhood. He also teaches her to use her cleverness to unlock tiny objects to find the treasures inside. To this reviewer, those incredible miniatures, made in such a rush by a father for his vulnerable six-year old girl as the Germans draw near, are the most unforgettable takeaways of the novel. And as her world is going up in conflagration, Marie-Laure‚Äôs fingertips race across the braille dots to open another world, the world of Twenty Thousand Leagues Beneath the Sea, which she broadcasts as the bombs fall. Marie-Laure, with her blindness, has a huge capacity for the world and human experience.Then there is Werner, a German boy, whose snowy white hair is almost as much a character marker as Marie-Laure‚Äôs blindness. He is an undersized orphan trying to look after his sister and others in the industrial area of Zollverein, Germany. Werner has a preternatural gift for mathematics and radios and, as a result, is spared going into the mines, but is scooped up into the German army where he becomes a radio operator.Marie-Laure and Werner cross paths when the Allies begin bombing the holdout of Saint-Malo in early August, 1944. During the most intense part of the circular, reiterative narrative, Werner is trapped in the basement of the Hotel of Bees because of a bomb hit. Marie-Laure is trapped not far away in the attic of her uncle‚Äôs house with the cursed jewel, The Sea of Flames, in her possession. A mad, dying Nazi stalks the downstairs desperate to get at the jewel, which he believes will save his life.Thankfully, Doerr lets a long, comforting resolution play out as we see what happens to the survivors of the bombing of Saint-Malo. We see the survivors intermittently as they go about life-after-the-war until 2014 (the novels pub date). So vicariously was I participating in this novel, if I should go to Paris this year (fat chance), I would keep an eye out for an elderly blind lady who seems to know where she is going. And I do believe some evil potential, buffeted and stained to look like ordinary sea rock, is always being swished around on the ocean floor waiting to be found and polished.Doerr expands the literal plot line (this-happens-then-this-happens-then-this-happens) with a richness of inversions, paradoxes, oxymorons, juxtapositions, repetitions, symbols, and motifs that invite the reader to go beyond the storyline. For example:‚Ä¢ Clearly, a mollusk is not just a mollusk. And what‚Äôs with all those birds?‚Ä¢ Before two of the most heart-breaking events of the narrative (the rape and Werner‚Äôs death), why are there quasi-Eucharistic events?‚Ä¢ Why is the fabulous diamond, The Sea of Flames, given such an oxymoronic name?‚Ä¢ How can we not see light?‚Ä¢ Why is Twenty Thousand Leagues Beneath the Sea the message of comfort to all who hear Marie-Laure‚Äôs last broadcast? (On the surface, it would seem to be an inversion of the usual message of hope.)‚Ä¢ Why can the story be read pretty effectively backwards?Doerr‚Äôs story has become an earwig. Certain images, characters, events, and themes will always remain in my head. More than any novel I‚Äôve read in years, I felt that I was buried with Werner below the Hotel of Bees. I was in the cold orphanage attic with him when, as a boy, he listened to a faraway voice talking about the nature of light on the radio. I was as hungry as Marie-Laure contemplating opening the last unlabeled can of food in the attic.As an adult who has read a gazillion novels, I‚Äôve largely lost my childhood ability to be carried away into another world by a story. So thank you, Anthony Doerr, for letting me do that again.",TRUE,23-02-2017,"Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2017",1501173219
67,All the Light We Cannot See: A Novel,One of my favorite reads this year!,Lee,5,"I find this review a bit difficult to write because honestly, I don‚Äôt know where to start! All the Light We Cannot See is like no other book that I‚Äôve read before. On its surface, this book is about a young German boy with a talent for fixing radios and a blind French girl who possesses a curiosity and courage way beyond her years ‚Äì both thrown helplessly into a world torn apart by war and devastation and the impact this has on their lives. But this book is so much more than that! It is about survival, love, courage, family, friendship, etc but on a deeper level, it is also a ""study"" on human nature and what it means to ""do what is expected"" versus ""do what is right.""The author Anthony Doerr has a masterful way with words ‚Äì the richness in detail with which he describes every character / event / scene in the book paints a vivid picture of what life was like in the midst of war, yet he does so in a manner that does not take away from the story itself. He does not bog the story down with long, tedious paragraphs or pages and pages of detailed description that make readers like me want to just skip ahead to the actual story and not bother with the details. Instead, he uses brevity as a powerful tool ‚Äì in just a few words, short phrases, sometimes not even complete sentences, he is able to bring to life not only his characters and the situations they encounter, but also draw the reader into their world to experience it for ourselves. As I was reading, I actually felt like I was being transported back to that time period (mid 1930s to 1940s), walking alongside the characters, seeing what they were seeing, feeling what they were feeling. The atrocities of war described in the book were very harsh and very real, despite this being a work of fiction. I actually winced during some of the parts where an atrocity was being described and had to set the book aside for a few minutes to calm myself. I‚Äôve read other books in the past about his time period, about World War II and the atrocities of war, but none of those books had the impact this one did. Thinking about it now, I realize why: those books either use WWII merely as a backdrop without going into much detail or if they do, the events are portrayed in a way that makes it feel like a story or a recounting of history ‚Äì as a reader, you are told what happened during that time period but don‚Äôt really feel a connection to it. This book, in its uniqueness, actually makes you LIVE that history rather than just read about it.The other unique aspect to this book was the storyline involving the cursed stone, which brought an unexpected element of suspense that still blended in perfectly with the rest of the story. In the hands of a less capable author, incorporating this part of the story might ruin the book entirely, but with Doerr, this is definitely not the case ‚Äì he is consistent with the details as well as the storytelling and incorporates this arc seamlessly throughout the book. I found myself at the edge of my seat at certain points wanting to find out what happens next -- whether the stone would be found, whether certain characters would get caught, etc. I enjoyed this part of the book immensely!My only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù about this book would be in its structure, as the story is told in different timeframes and switches back and forth after every couple chapters. This interrupted the flow a bit and did slow me down at times when reading, since I had to go back and re-read certain parts in order to remember where the previous timeframe left off. It also caused a little bit of confusion for me initially with some of the characters who were already part of the story when the book opens but then are introduced for the first time when things switch back to the earlier timeframe, then it picks up with what happens to that character from the later timeframe when it switches again. Not a show-stopper by any means of course, but I think the book would‚Äôve been easier to get through if it didn‚Äôt switch back and forth. I'm pretty sure there was significance to structuring the book this way but unfortunately it was lost on me.Despite this long review that I just wrote, I actually don‚Äôt feel like I did this book any justice. In fact, no review can do this book much justice because it is a book that can‚Äôt just be ‚Äúdescribed‚Äù -- you basically have to read and experience it for yourself. For me personally, I loved this book and I know this is a story that will stay with me for a long time to come.

70,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) (The Hunger Games),This is not a hero story,Anne Pruitt,5,"4.5 starsAmazon delivered my copy early, so I'm going to do a spoiler free review and then a spoilery one. Pardon if this winds up sounding like an English paper. I have thought so much on the morals and questions in this book that I feel like I should have read this in school.Note: I'm writing this review with the express belief that you, reader, have at least read the book description. Otherwise why are you reading this review?I want to start this off by saying two things. One, this is not a hero story. Snow is never once, in my opinion, shown to be a hero in this in what we modern folks would call a hero. He's no Luke Skywalker or redeemed villain. This isn't some sob backstory to explain ""why the bad guy is bad."" This is yet another set of layers to the onion that is Snow.Second, this book is dark. It's been a minute since I read the original trilogy, but I swear it wasn't quite as graphic as this book was. Cannibalism is mentioned, and it's shown/talked about that someone sawed the leg off a dead woman and ran off with it. One character is killed then hung on a hook and paraded. Another is also gruesomely displayed after their death. Several characters are dragged through processions to ""prove a point,"" another character is hung from two large poles and left to basically die in the sun. Multiple accounts of vomiting/poison throughout, and a general unpleasantness at the lack of regard for human life.Non-spoilery review:This book makes you think. A lot. It makes you question things, and wonder if maybe Snow is right (he's not), but it's written in such a way that he's not a villain. Donald Sutherland in an interview made a great point in saying that Snow isn't a villain, he's just a ruthless man doing what he thinks is right to keep his home and country in one piece.""He does it so well. And he doesn't think he's a bad person. He thinks it's the only way society can survive. And whether you think he's right or wrong, he doesn't think he's bad. He likes himself.""This should be the mantra for this book. Snow is a conflicting, flawed human. In our society, he's evil, a sociopath or a psychopath. He's a murderer and a killer. He's a bad guy. In his world, he's one of the masses. He simply lives as he's been raised to, with a mentality that has been ingrained in him since the war between the Districts and the Capitol. He's simply more ruthless then most and has the guts to make what he considers the ""hard decisions.""Regardless of the other characters in this, they're all props to his story--which fits well with the Snow we know from The Hunger Games. Everyone is second stage to Snow and his life. This is his evolution from being a child to a man, to becoming the Snow we know and love/hate.I definitely don't think this book is for everyone. I'm sitting here with my mom breathing down my neck because she can't wait to read it, and I don't think she'll like it at all, and she's a diehard THG trilogy fan. Why? Because not everyone likes to read depressing books. There's no redemption in this. There's no saving someone from themselves. This is the fall, stumble, plummet into being a not great person and embracing it fully.So take that as you will. Full spoilers below about everything.P.s. This is a standalone.SPOILERS BELOWOkay, so, I was worried about this book when I read the first chapter sample and it got announced that Snow would be training the District 12 girl. I thought, oh crap, it's gonna be a cliche YA. It's gonna have a stupid romance that undercuts the whole plot and makes him a sap. And yeah, it did that, and up until the last 50 pages I was teetering on a 3-3.5 stars. And then oh boy, the end.Lucy Grey was a sweet girl, but she felt off since the beginning. I still can't fully put my finger on it, but her and Snow's relationship felt so <i>wrong</i> the entirety of the book. The red flags went up repeatedly every time he made comments about how she was his, and even so far as to say she was his property, and that's all kinds of wrong. And even though their romance was cute and fluffy, it felt bad, tainted. You knew something was going to happen. It always does in these villain backstories. Usually the whole reason the villain is bad is because the love interest gets brutally killed and then they're like whelp, guess I'll just be evil.Not in this book.Snow constantly struggles with morality and right and wrong throughout this. Should he turn in his friend to the Capitol because they're colluding with rebels and could tear down the (flawed) infrastructure? Or should he turn a blind eye and let his friend do his own thing? Is the Hunger Games wrong or good? Is it wrong to view the District people as second class humans? And so on. This book broaches the topic of racism in very broad terms with the whole District/Capitol thing. You've always known there was a divide between them, but in this, you really see how much the Capitol looks down on the Districts, and you can easily see how that morphs into such a hatred and distaste by the time Katniss first enters the Hunger Games.But I digress. Snow struggles with morality, but he's flawed and very, very imperfect. He rationalizes every death he takes as self-defense or some other reason when really he's just murdered someone because it's inconvenient for him. He kills (or at least removes her from the picture; it's ambiguous) Lucy Grey in the end because she's a loose end and too free. He does it. Not someone else, not some freak accident. He chooses to do it and, by the time it happens, you already know what direction he's headed in so it's not quite another nail in the coffin. It fully feels like him tying up loose ends so he can go do whatever he wants.All the nods to THG characters and names was cool. You also had a lot of The Great Gatsby vibes in the Old Money versus New Money mentality that a lot of the Capitol had with District people who gained a fortune and bought their way into the Capitol life. They're looked down upon by the old families and viewed as trash.You saw a lot of the evolution in the Hunger Games, and you can see how it begins to change and grow into what Katniss and Peeta suffered through. You see how it begins to change from a simple punishment to a sport and a holiday, with the growing encouragement that it should be a normal and good thing.You also see a side of the Capitol you most definitely did not see in the trilogy--suffering. A lot of the book shows Snow struggling with having been a small child living through the Dark Days and the war. He was 8 when the Capitol won, and even then it was hard. You learn about the hell the Capitol lived through as they were besieged by the Districts' army and forced to ration, starvation, and cannibalism. It's a hard picture, and it's so blatantly told. Collins didn't hold back any punches in this. I never felt like what was done was for shock and awe for the reader, but it was definitely that for the story, and it made sense. Regardless of the Capitol not being at war with the Districts anymore, the tensions were still so high that it makes sense for the Capitol to overreact in their retaliation of events. So when one mentor gets killed by her tribute, they shoot the tribute and parade her body around on a hook at the mentor's funeral. It's disgusting, debasing, and shows how much the Capitol views the Districts as nothing more than rodents or livestock.Anyway, I'll stop talking. Go read it yourself. It's a hard read, a heavy read, but it was very, very enjoyable.",TRUE,24-05-2020,"Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2020",1339016575
71,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) (The Hunger Games),"Ted Bundy, Coriolanus and The Joker",MJ,5,"The Ballad of Songbirds and SnakesAs most readers already know, this prequel explores Coriolanus's life when he was a teenager. The opening chapters reveal that he was also chosen to be a mentor for Lucy Gray who was from the despised district 12.But what she lacks in fighting skills she makes up for being a charismatic performer. Lucy Gray learned how to work a situation to her advantage.In the beginning the tributes did not enjoy Capitol luxuries but were kept in cages and barely fed. It‚Äôs a stark contrast to the future hunger games when tributes were met with an extravagant welcome and dined on rich foods.The problem was that watching too much brutality turned the Capitol away from the Games. Snow's addition to the Hunger Games of costumes, interviews, and the underdog tributes made the propaganda go down easy. This should be a cautionary tale.A lot of readers are not getting the point the author is trying to make. In the opening of this book there's a quote by Hobbes:‚ÄúHereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man.‚Äù ‚Äî Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, 1651Coriolanus's first ""lesson"" to be molded into the future oppressor was during the Hunger Games; when he was forced to go in the arena to get out Sejanus, one of the mentors, who was not supposed to be in there. While at the hospital getting stitches, the head gamekeeper, Dr. Gaul, asked if Coriolanus understood what he was supposed to learn.‚ÄúWithout the threat of death, it wouldn‚Äôt have been much of a lesson,‚Äù said Dr. Gaul. ‚ÄúWhat happened in the arena? That‚Äôs humanity undressed. The tributes. And you, too. How quickly civilization disappears. All your fine manners, education, family background, everything you pride yourself on, stripped away in the blink of an eye, revealing everything you actually are. A boy with a club who beats another boy to death. That‚Äôs mankind in its natural state.‚Äù‚ÄúI think I wouldn‚Äôt have beaten anyone to death if you hadn‚Äôt stuck me in that arena!‚Äù he retorted.‚ÄúYou can blame it on the circumstances, the environment, but you made the choices you made, no one else. It‚Äôs a lot to take in all at once, but it‚Äôs essential that you make an effort to answer that question. Who are human beings? Because who we are determines the type of governing we need. Later on, I hope you can reflect and be honest with yourself about what you learned tonight.‚ÄùA very similar thought process was also stated by the Joker in The Dark Night:‚ÄúTo them, you‚Äôre just a freak, like me! They need you right now, but when they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll cast you out, like a leper! You see, their morals, their code, it‚Äôs a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They‚Äôre only as good as the world allows them to be. I‚Äôll show you. When the chips are down, these‚Ä¶ these civilized people, they‚Äôll eat each other. See, I‚Äôm not a monster. I‚Äôm just ahead of the curve.‚ÄùBoth the Joker and Dr. Gaul has distorted thinking. It's one thing to make a choice freely and it's quite another thing to be forced into one.Human nature is such that coercive enforcement of rules is indispensable to protect the rights of all but there is a fine line between government rule and government oppression.Later, as Coriolanus's feelings toward Lucy Gray grew, he helped her to survive the games only to get caught and was sent to train with the peacekeepers in her district. Sejanus joined him there soon after.Sejanus was never one who was comfortable with the Capital and its way of life. He got a plan to help the districts by providing the rebels with guns for their flight up north, out of Panem.Coriolanus found out about Sejanus‚Äô plot. Mayfair threatens to tell her father [the Mayor] everything, which would implicate Coriolanus and Lucy Gray despite them being only bystanders; he shot her.Sejanus is charged with treason and hanged. And Lucy Gray Baird is the main suspect in Billy Taupe [her ex rebel boyfriend] and Mayfair‚Äôs deaths, as he left her for the mayor‚Äôs daughter.In desperation, Lucy Gray decides to join the rebels up north and Coriolanus decides to go with her, thinking there's nothing left of his life once the murder weapons were found.But as they prepare to flee district 12, Snow gets paranoid that Lucy Gray is betraying him. When they stop at a house near district 12‚Äôs lake, he discovers the rebels‚Äô store of the weapons. When Lucy Gray takes a long time to cut up some katniss plants, he convinces himself that she has abandoned him and went to turn him in.""What if they interrogated or even tortured her? The story would come out. She hadn't killed anyone. He had. His word against hers"".But even though Snow searches for her, Lucy Gray was nowhere to be found.The three killings that Snow did throughout the book contributed to his downward spiral and PTSD. Coriolanus clubbed to death a tribute, Bobbin, in the Hunger Games arena. He also shoots the mayor's daughter and also turns in his best friend, Sejanus, for treason, resulting in his execution.Lucy Gray was the last straw for his sanity. Back at the Capital the reader sees Snow's change to ""the dark side"".""Sometimes he would remember a moment of sweetness and almost wish things had ended differently. But it would never have worked out between them, even if he‚Äôd stayed. They were simply too different. And he didn‚Äôt like love, the way it had made him feel stupid and vulnerable. If he ever married, he‚Äôd choose someone incapable of swaying his heart. Someone he hated, even, so they could never manipulate him the way Lucy Gray had. Never make him feel jealous. Or weak. Livia Cardew would be perfect. He imagined the two of them, the president and his first lady, presiding over the Hunger Games a few years from now. He‚Äôd continue the Games, of course, when he ruled Panem. People would call him a tyrant, ironfisted and cruel. But at least he would ensure survival for survival‚Äôs sake, giving them a chance to evolve. What else could humanity hope for? Really, it should thank him.""This happened to Ted Bundy as I believe one of the main reasons he became a serial killer was because his first love dumped him. If you were to get all his victims lined up together you would think they were all sisters and you will notice that they all look like his first girlfriend.Rejection is a powerful force in a person's life if they are not stable. Dr. Gaul planted the seeds for that rejection to take root and grow.",TRUE,25-07-2020,"Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2020",1339016575
72,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) (The Hunger Games),A fantastic villain origin story,Holly,5,"I adored the Hunger Games series. Dystopian YA is not a normal genre for me, but this series is awesome and this prequel? A fantastic villain origin story.Coriolanus Snow is an ambitious 18-year-old student whose wealthy family barely survived the war. He is all about image and pretense, which often vie against his normal, human feelings. His parents are dead and he lives in a rundown apartment with his grandmother and cousin Tigris.But, the 10th Hunger Games is to be the first one with mentors and Coriolanus has been chosen to mentor the female tribute from District 12. While at first humiliated at not being given a more highly rated district, he quickly realizes that Lucy Gray is someone who could win and it's up to him to figure out how to help her do that. Along the way, Coriolanus learns about love and the dangers it can bring.As he works his way through the Games, he also discovers who wields the power in the Capitol, who controls the games and what he needs to do to rise up above the masses.The student mentors also have a say in how the games are run, and in a somewhat twisted sort of way, their professor gives assignments and in Coriolanus' essays, we see how future Games come about and evolve. As the mentors talk about the games and what is happening, we also see how they are not all unfeeling or unkind. They view their tributes as people and they can see how unfair the Games really are. At the same time we see that those in the Capitol are only concerned about their well being and that their losses are because of the rebels.The Hunger Games series is vibrant and colorful in its imagery. This book, however, was almost more black and gray in its imagery, what with the rubble of the arena and the Capitol still trying to rebuild from the war. That made the contrast of Lucy Gray's colorful skirt and the snakes all the more striking.As with the rest of the series, we see the government oppression, we see the results of war and rebellion. We see society broken, but fighting and we see that even with survival, life isn't grand and colorful. But we also see that the human spirit is strong.No one likes who President Snow becomes and I think writing about his story so that he gains the reader's sympathy is brilliant.

73,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) (The Hunger Games),An author's initial perspective on The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,L.V.

But I knew I had to let go of that bias because this is an entirely new thing. I need to read this not as a reader, but as an author. So I approached this book with a careful eye, just like any other character who approaches a jabberjay in the series.The perspective of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes isn't new to me simply because it's from the villain's voice. It's ""new"" in a way as it explores the coming of age tale of Coriolanus Snow's cleverly paranoid overthinking mind.I knew what will happen to Coriolanus Snow, so I gripped my seat as I approved 80% in my Kindle Oasis. It was simply impossible. I don't see anything bad from happening. I asked myself, ""How will Suzanne Collins end this?""And she did.And I couldn't believe it.It was so captivating that I couldn't put it down.

74,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) (The Hunger Games),Quite the read...,Mama2one,5,"I have such mixed emotions after finishing this book, but first of all - this book is absolutely incredible. I honestly think it might be my favorite book of the HG series (!) and Ms. Collins absolutely does not disappoint with her writing and content. Getting to read about Panem, and thus the beginning of the HG was so gratifying and the way this story flowed into, and matched up with, the trilogy was absolutely flawless. Truly, it is excellent!Now - it's kind of rare to read a book when the protagonist is the villain. We all clearly know from the HG trilogy that President Snow is a pretty terrible person, yet reading this book, from his point of view, it's easy to forget that; but it's also fascinating to see how he thinks of himself and sees his own actions. Along that same thought - Snow is very charismatic and definitely knows how to work the people around him to get what he wants or to present himself in a way that will clearly benefit himself, often at the cost of someone else.~~Minor spoiler ~~The other part of Snow's life that I do find incredibly sad - while he definitely has poor character traits to begin with, he was also very manipulated by several people around him, which I think added *considerably* to how he turned out as an adult and VERY much shaped his viewpoint, and his creation of the games.So definitely worth the read (and re-read). This book is very thought-provoking, even from outside the dystopian viewpoint. There are a lot of reflections on who WE are - as humans; as groups & societies; on the roles of government and the rights of its citizens.For the many pages, it reads quickly!

This prequel takes readers on a journey to understand the origins of the Hunger Games and explores the complex character of Coriolanus Snow, who later becomes President Snow, giving him a lot more nuance than previously afforded. The story delves into the darker and more morally complex aspects of the Hunger Games world, offering a fresh perspective on the events that led to the dystopian society depicted in the original trilogy. While it may not have the same level of action and intensity as the earlier books, it compensates with its rich character development and thought-provoking themes and the lack of 'action' makes sense given the setting and novelty of the Hunger Games at that point.

The New York Times called the 2006 edition ‚Äúa slim volume of terrifying power,‚Äù yet its power wasn‚Äôt immediately appreciated. In fact, the book may have never been written had Wiesel not approached his friend, the novelist Francois Mauriac, for an introduction to the French Prime Minister Pierre Mendes-France, whom he wanted to interview. When Mauriac, a devoted Catholic, mentioned that Mendes-France was suffering like Jesus, Elie Wiesel responded, in the heat of the moment, that ten years earlier he had seen hundreds of Jewish children suffer more than Jesus did on the cross, yet nobody spoke about their suffering. Mauriac appeared moved and suggested that Wiesel himself write about it. The young man took his friend‚Äôs advice. He began writing in Yiddish an 862-page manuscript about his experiences of the Holocaust. The Central Union of Polish Jews in Argentina published in Yiddish an abbreviated version of this book, under the title And the World Remained Silent. Wiesel later translated the text into French. He called it, more simply and symbolically, Night (La Nuit), and sent it to Mauriac, who helped Wiesel find a publisher (the literary and small publishing house Les Editions de Minuit) and wrote its Preface. The English version, published in 1960 by Arthur Wang of Hill and Wang, received strong critical acclaim despite initially modest sales. Elie Wiesel‚Äôs eloquent and informed interviews helped bring the difficult subject of the Holocaust to the center of public attention. By 2006, Oprah Winfrey selected Night for her high-profile book club, further augmenting its exposure.This work is definitely autobiographical‚Äîan eloquent memoir documenting Wiesel‚Äôs family sufferings during the Holocaust‚Äîyet, due to its literary qualities, the text has been also read as a novel or fictionalized autobiography. The brevity, poignant dialogue, almost lyrical descriptions of human degradation and suffering, and historical accuracy of this multifaceted work render Night one of the most powerful Holocaust narratives ever written.Elie (Eliezer) Wiesel was only 15 years old when the Nazis entered Sighet in March of 1944, a small Romanian town in Northern Transylvania which had been annexed to Hungary in 1940. At the directives of Adolf Eichmann, who took it upon himself to ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù Hungary of its Jews, the situation deteriorated very quickly for the Jewish population of Sighet and other provincial towns. Within a few months, between May and July 1944, approximately 440,000 Hungarian Jews, mostly those living outside of Budapest, were deported to Auschwitz aboard 147 trains.Wiesel‚Äôs entire family‚Äîhis father Chlomo, his mother Sarah, and his sisters Tzipora, Hilda and Beatrice‚Äîsuffered this fate. Among them, only Elie and two of his sisters, Hilda and Beatrice, managed to survive the Holocaust. However, since the women and the men were separated at Auschwitz upon arrival, Elie lost track of what happened to his sisters until they reunited after the war. In the concentration camps, father and son clung to each other. Night recounts their horrific experiences, which included starvation, forced labor, and a death march to Buchenwald. Being older and weaker, Chlomo becomes the target of punishment and humiliation: he‚Äôs beaten by SS officers and by other prisoners who want to steal his food. Weakened by starvation and fatigue, he dies after a savage beating in January 1945, sadly, only a few weeks before the Americans liberated the concentration camp. Throughout their tribulations, the son oscillates between a paternal sense of responsibility towards his increasingly debilitated father and regarding his father as a burden that might cost him his own life. Elie doesn‚Äôt dare intervene when the SS officer beats Chlomo, fearing that he himself will become the next victim if he tries to help his father. In the darkness and despair of Night, the instinct of self-preservation from moment to moment counteracts a lifetime of familial love. Even when Elie discovers the death of his father in the morning, he experiences through a sense of absence: not only his father‚Äôs absence, as his bunk is now occupied by another inmate, but also the lack of his own human response: ‚ÄúI did not weep, and it pained me that I could not weep. But I was out of tears. And deep inside me, if I could have searched the recesses of my feeble conscience, I might have found something like: Free at last!...‚Äù (112)Night is offers a stark psychological account the process of human and moral degradation in inhumane conditions. Even the relatively few and fortunate survivors of the Nazi atrocities, such as Elie, became doubly victimized: the victims of everything they suffered at the hands of their oppressors and the victims of everything they witnessed others suffer and were unable or, perhaps more sadly, unwilling to help. Although Night focuses on the loss of humanity in the Nazi concentration camps, the author‚Äôs life would become a quest for regaining it again, in far better conditions, if at least one condition is met: caring about the suffering of others. As Wiesel explains to his audience on December 10, 1986 during his acceptance speech of the Nobel Prize in Oslo, his message to his son--and his message to the world at large‚Äîis about the empathy required to keep the Holocaust memory alive. He reminds us all, ‚Äúthat I have tried to keep memory alive, that I have tried to fight those who would forget. Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices. ‚Ä¶ We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented‚Äù (118).Claudia Moscovici, Holocaust Memory",TRUE,14-10-2015,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2015",374500010
84,Night (Night),Some Thoughts about NIGHT -- Today,Arlene Sanders,5,"The risk inherent in writing about the Holocaust is that today's readers have a hard time believing it. Those of us who did not experience the horrors of living in a Nazi death camp cannot begin to understand what it was like. Battered women and severely abused children living today, trapped in circumstances they cannot escape, may come close.But most of us have no frame of reference. Nothing in our experience even remotely compares.This ""I can't believe it"" mentality was also common among non-Jewish civilians who lived in Germany during the Third Reich--when Adolf Hitler was in power (1933-1945).Even as ""night"" descended on Wiesel's little town--Sighet, Transylvania (Hungary)--the Jewish people could not believe what was happening. Moishe the Beadle was ""deported"" by the Hungarian police, crammed into a cattle car and taken to a forest in Poland to be executed with other Jews. Incredibly, Moishe escaped and returned to Sighet with his story:""The train had stopped. The Jews were ordered to get off and onto waiting trucks. The trucks headed toward a forest. There everybody was ordered to get out. They were forced to dig huge trenches. When they had finished their work, the men from the Gestapo began theirs. Without passion or haste, they shot their prisoners, who were forced to approach the trench one by one and offer their necks. . . .""Moishe's escape was a miracle. He was wounded in the leg and left for dead. In Sighet, he went from house to house, telling his story, but the people refused to listen. Even the young Elie Wiesel did not believe him.The denial continued. In Jewish families about to be transported to Auschwitz, ""the women were boiling eggs, roasting meat, preparing cakes, sewing backpacks.""Wiesel does not challenge us to comprehend the gas chamber deaths of his mother and little sister Tzipora. Instead, he writes what we can grasp: ""Tzipora was holding Mother's hand. I saw them walking farther and farther away; Mother was stroking my sister's blond hair as if to protect her. And I walked on with my father, with the men. I didn't know that this was the moment in time and the place where I was leaving my mother and Tzipora forever.""Wiesel describes with remarkable restraint a vicious beating he receives from a Kapo: I felt the sweat running down my back. ""A-7713!"" I stepped forward. ""A crate!"" he ordered. They brought a crate. ""Lie down on it! On your belly!"" I obeyed. I no longer felt anything except the lashes of the whip. ""One!. . . Two!. . ."" he was counting. He took his time between lashes. Only the first really hurt. I heard him count. ""Ten. . .eleven!. . ."" His voice was calm and reached me as through a thick wall. ""Twenty-three. . ."" Two more, I thought, half unconscious. The Kapo was waiting. ""Twenty-four. . .twenty five!"" It was over. . . . ""Listen to me, you son of a swine!"" said Idek coldly. ""So much for your curiosity. You shall receive five times more if you dare tell anyone what you saw! Understood?"" I nodded, once, ten times, endlessly. As if my head had decided to say yes for all eternity.Elie Wiesel's magnificent NIGHT bridges that enormous gulf between ""I can't believe it"" and the mind-numbing, horrific sinking in of the realization of ""Oh, dear God, this really happened."" His account is straightforward, almost matter-of-fact, with a minimum of frenzy, inordinate dwelling on flames of infernos, prolonged death throes, or metaphysical discourses about evil.He does talk about his relationship with God throughout the ordeal. And of course about his father, who was with him in Auschwitz and Buchenwald.Why did Wiesel write this book? He tells us:""There are those who tell me that I survived in order to write this text. I am not convinced. I don't know how I survived; I was weak, rather shy; I did nothing to save myself. A miracle? Certainly not. If heaven could or would perform a miracle for me, why not for others more deserving than myself? It was nothing more than chance. However, having survived, I needed to give some meaning to my survival. . . .""In retrospect I must confess that I do not know, or no longer know, what I wanted to achieve with my words. I only know that without this testimony, my life as a writer--or my life, period--would not have become what it is: that of a witness who believes he has a moral obligation to try to prevent the enemy from enjoying one last victory by allowing his crimes to be erased from human memory. . . .""I am grateful for this book and for Marion Wiesel's excellent and sensitive translation of her husband's memoir. Some great literature has come out of the Holocaust. In my opinion, Elie Wiesel's NIGHT is the best book, and certainly one of the most deeply moving among these works.Arlene Sanders",TRUE,03-06-2010,"Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2010",374500010

87,Night (Night),Matter of Fact Horrors,Gary F. Taylor,5,"NIGHT was among the first widely read accounts of a Holocaust concentration camp survivor. It was originally over eight hundred pages in Yiddish. Weisel worked with the material, re-writing and editing it, first into a two hundred forty five page version published in Argenitina, then into a one hundred seventy page version published in France. NIGHT reached its final form with its one hundred sixteen page publication in 1960 in English in the United States. Wiesel declares that every word of the work is true and he describes NIGHT as his ""testimony."" Critics tend to feel that the basis for the work is factual, but that Wiesel's long and meticulous re-write and editing has transformed what would have been simple fact into a work of art open to a variety of understandings. Whatever the case, the English-language publication was among the first widely read personal accounts of the Holocaust, and it continues to draw both readers and praise to the present day.The book is written in an unexpectedly matter of fact tone and lacks any trace of self-pity. As such it has an quality that is very difficult to define, one in which most human emotion seems to have been burned away by the experiences the writer endured. Elie Wiesel was born in 1928 in Sighet, a fairly large town first claimed by Romania and later by Hungary. Wiesel writes that he was a studious boy, deeply religious, and the son of respected people. They had heard rumors of how Jews were treated by Germans, but the war seemed very far away, and the stories were incredible to them--even when they were told by a man well known to the Jewish community. The process was fairly slow, with Jews forced to wear the Star of David, prohibited from this and that, and finally forced to live in two ""ghettos"" in the city. Then, in May 1944, the Jews of Sighet were deported to Auschwitz. Wiesel was sixteen at the time. He would spend about year in various camps before arriving at Buchenwald, where he was liberated by Allied Forces in 1945. When he saw himself in a mirror for the first time since his incarceration, he was horrified by the reflection, which seemed to be that of a living corpse.The book has an abrupt and episodic nature, but most of it focuses on Wiesel's relationship with his father Schlomo Wiesel, and how the two men successfully stayed together during their time in the camps, and how the two men less successfully attempted to care for each other. Although NIGHT is filled with horrors, the ultimate one occurs when the grinding hell of the camp system causes Wiesel to reject feeling for his father as a hinderance to his own survival. Wiesel is also prompted to question God, and whether God exists, and if so how God can accept the Nazi's systematic destruction of the Jews. As one individual cynically comments to Wiesel in NIGHT, he believes in Hitler--because Hitler has kept every promise he ever made to the Jews.There are moments of light scattered in the work--stars in the darkness--a Frenchwoman who risks herself to encourage Wiesel, a friend whose dying act is a gift of music--but for the most part NIGHT is night indeed, and there is no escape. For all its brevity, it is painful to read, difficult to grasp, and incredibly frightening in the ordinary tone in which it is told. The book is published with a preface by Wiesel, a forward by Francois Mauriac, and the text of Wiesel's 1986 speech in acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",TRUE,07-08-2014,"Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2014",374500010
88,Night (Night),Witness to Unspeakable Horrors of the Holocaust,Book Club Member,5,"This moving memoir is a raw firsthand account of the horrors of the holocaust. Covering a time period of 1941-1945, Elie Wiesel first recounts his life as a young Jewish boy living in a small town in Hungary. Despite the aggression of the Nazis, Elie's family felt themselves to be relatively safe because of the distance from the other German- occupied areas and because they were sure that the war would be over before any harm could come to them. Had they been able to foresee the future, they would have taken advantage of an opportunity they had to emigrate to Palestine. But by 1944, the unthinkable happened, gradually at first. In a series of escalating indignities, Jews lost their rights to conduct business, to own jewels, and were forced to wear yellow stars while living in Ghettos. All the while, Elie's family remained hopeful that the war would be over soon. Not until the transport out of town was announced did they realize the precariousness of their situation. But even then and in the cattle cars, they could not have anticipated the sheer terror of the concentration camps and crematoria. Once they arrived in Auschwitz, Elie's memories are focused on his father and himself, because he never saw his mother or sister again after they got off the train. Elie witnessed unspeakable atrocities, such as hundreds of people forced to dig their own graves before being shot and babies being tossed alive into fires in trenches. Elie and his father were sentenced to hard labor and endured strenuous marches from camp to camp, while trying to survive on one or two rations of soup and bread a day. Eventually, Elie's father succumbed to malnutrition and dysentery. In the midst of such misery, Elie pondered why he should even care to continue living. After liberation by the Americans, Elie happened to pass by a mirror for the first time in years. He was stunned to see what he thought was a corpse staring back at him. The whole book is quite disturbing but should be required reading so that the past mistakes of singling out a section of society by race, color, or creed to be the scapegoats for all evils must not be repeated.",TRUE,14-02-2022,"Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2022",374500010
89,Night (Night),Haunting and powerfully tragic ...,DACHokie,5,"After reading ""Night"", I realized that it is the first book I've read that was authored by a Holocaust survivor. I was so absorbed by Elie Weisel's tale of absolute misery and despair that it only took me a little over an hour to read the entire book ... and I've found myself thinking about it's contents ever since. It is also the first book I've read that actually made me feel the authors pain.The books starts with the feeling that Germany's defeat was imminent, Weisel conveys a sense of complacency in that it appeared he and his family would be spared the worse with the Red Army's rapid westward advance to Germany. Even when Germany invades Hungary in the spring of 1944, Weisel and his family appeared content to wait for the Russians. This proved to be a grave miscalculation as the Nazis begin deporting Jews from the ghetto to labor camps in Poland ... at this point, Weisel and his father are separated from his mother and younger sister. The remainder of the book is about survival based on ingenuity, fate and others' misfortunes. As he and his father trudge through the hell of Auschwitz; it isn't until later that Weisel begins to assume the fate of his sister and mother.Throughout the book, death is both random and a frequent sight, with the lines of people plodding to the chimneys that endlessly spew the ashes of thousands upon thousands ... a constant reminder of his inevitable fate. Weisel frequently contemplates his faith in God, because there is no way, he believes, that God would allow such inhumanity on such a grand scale. When the thundering artillery of the approaching Red Army are actually being felt, the Nazis crudely force the inmates of Auschwitz on a death march to Germany that only the strong could possibly survive. At this point Weisel sees and feels how the bonds of family become unglued when starvation becomes extreme and how the endless dead are unceremoniously disposed. Buchenwald is the final destination of the death march and it is there where Weisel experiences his ultimate loss and eventual liberation by the Americans.At 120 pages (including a transcript of the author's Nobel Prize speech), Weisel didn't need many words to bring forth the pain, suffering and loss he experienced and witnessed. I found myself constantly putting myself in Weisel's shoes, often wondering how he had the will, at sixteen years of age, to endure such horrific circumstances. I intended to be critical of this book in that it left me with so many questions, mainly follow-up questions, like Weisel's thoughts looking back. But, with the book still making me think several days after I read it, I accepted and appreciated ""Night"" for what it was ... a nightmare that became reality for a teenager ... a capsule of that particular moment in time, no more, no less.",TRUE,10-02-2010,"Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2010",374500010
90,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,Updated review after 100 days building small yet lasting habits.,Haical Sajovic Haddad,5,"I previously wrote this review right after reading the book. Today, February 15th, after applying James‚Äôs system for 100 days on a few tiny habits, I feel compelled to share updates with you because they have sincerely worked.I will divide the review into 5 parts. The first part is a summary of the book with short excerpts highlighted while taking notes. Next, I hope to share pieces of advice that have motivated me while building new habits. Following that, I will share how I implemented the first 3 habits throughout these months. Then, some thoughts to whom I would recommend reading the book. Last, there are 4 complementary readings.SUMMARY[Introduction] James starts by sharing personal strategies he implemented to recover from a serious accident in high school. That event forced him to improve the quality of his routine to get his life in order, coming to the conclusion that ‚Äúwe all deal with setbacks, but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you will end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.‚Äù[Section I : The Fundamentals][Chapter 1] Here we learn the power of compounding effect: changes that seem small and unimportant at any given day will compound into remarkable results if we are willing to stick with them for months and years. James explains that ‚Äúbreakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.‚Äù Comparing to habits, he shows that bamboo can barely be seen during the first couple of years while the roots grow underground before exploding for almost 100 feet into the air in a few weeks. From that perspective, we come to understand the best outcomes are generally delayed.[Chapter 2] Based on a 3-layer concentric circle behavior change model‚Äîdivided into outcome change, process change, and identity change‚ÄîJames explains that we should pay attention to our inner identity by focusing on beliefs, assumptions, and values. ‚ÄúMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.‚Äù The strongest changes, then, happen from inside out, starting from our identity, passing through the process, and ultimately changing the outcome.[Chapter 3] In this chapter we are introduced to a 4-step framework, which is composed of cue, craving, response, and reward. James calls it 'The 4 Laws of Behavior Change'. He then explains that we can think of each law as a lever that influences our behavior‚Äîwhen the levers are in the right positions, they create good habits effortless whereas when they are in the wrong position, it is nearly impossible. Through examples, he explains that ‚Äúthe cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.‚Äù Together they create a habit loop that, when repeated many times, habits become automatic.[Section II : Make It Obvious][Chapter 4] A primer on how cues play a crucial role in predicting habit formation without consciously thinking about the outcomes. Once our habits become so common, the cues associated with them become essentially invisible because they are deeply encoded. If we want to create better habits, a good idea is to be aware of the cues. James finishes up by sharing a strategy called 'Habits Scorecard'‚Äîa simple exercise to become more aware of our behavior on a daily basis. We first write down a chronological list of our daily habits and, once we have a full list, we score each habit as an effective, ineffective, or neutral habit. Besides noticing what is actually going on, we can notice if certain behaviors help us become the type of person we wish to be.[Chapter 5] The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms, and the 2 most common cues are time and location. When we make a specific plan for when and where we will perform a new habit, we are more likely to follow through. Stacking our habits by pairing a new habit with a current habit is a form to connect our behavior to our own advantage. An example when building a daily journaling habit would be: ‚Äúafter I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will journal for 5 minutes.‚Äù[Chapter 6] This chapter shows how our environment plays a crucial role in defining habit behaviors. ‚ÄúGiven that we are more dependent on vision than any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior.‚Äù To build good habits, then, we should either make desirable cues obvious in our environment or build new habits in a new environment to avoid fighting against old ones.[Chapter 7] One of the most practical ways to break a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. As James points out, ‚Äúit is easier to avoid temptation than resist it.‚Äù[Section III : Make It Attractive][Chapter 8] James explains how the modern food industry has created products that are more attractive and addictive to consumers, and by doing so he shows that the more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming tends to be associated with higher levels of dopamine. It is the anticipation of a reward that motivates us to take action. ‚ÄúTemptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.‚Äù[Chapter 9] ‚ÄúWe tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.‚Äù That said, it is common to pick up habits and behaviors from our parents, peers, and colleagues. There is also a tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the tribe. And, finally, we try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves. One of the best strategies to build better habits is to join a culture where the desired behavior is the normal behavior.[Chapter 10] To avoid unnecessary and detrimental cravings, we should highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit by making it seem unattractive. ‚ÄúHabits are unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.‚Äù[Section IV : Make It Easy][Chapter 11] ‚ÄúAll habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.‚Äù The key component is to pay close attention to the frequency we perform a habit, not much for how long we have been practicing it.[Chapter 12] Since every action requires a certain amount of energy, we are motivated to do what is easy. By contrast, the more energy required, the less likely it is to occur. ‚ÄúYou don't actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the obstacle, the more friction there is between you and your desired end state.‚Äù That is why we should reduce the friction associated with our habits by creating a prosperous environment to make future actions easier.[Chapter 13] There are decisive moments that deliver an outsized impact every single day. As James puts, these decisive moments are a fork in the road, sending us in the direction of a productive path or an unproductive one. To avoid procrastination, the skill of 'Showing Up' says that we should start a new habit by taking baby steps, making it as easy as possible to take action. ‚ÄúA new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first 2 minutes should be easy. What you want is a gateway habit that naturally leads you down a more productive path.‚Äù He calls it the 'Two-Minute Rule', meaning that new habits should take less than 2 minutes to do in the beginning. Once the habit is established we can improve and master the finer details.[Chapter 14] In order to keep bad habits away is to make them difficult in the first place. There are 2 interesting strategies to improve our future behavior. [1] Make good choices in advance before we can fall victim to temptation in the future. James gives a personal example by sharing that whenever he is looking to cut calories he will ask the waiter to split his meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. If, however, he waits for the meal to be served and tries to eat just half, that would never happen. [2] Make onetime actions that can automate our future habits and deliver increasing returns over time such as buying a good water filter, unsubscribing from unwanted emails, moving to a friendlier neighborhood, buying a standing desk, or setting up automatic bill pay.[Section V : Make It Satisfying][Chapter 15] We should make sure to feel immediately satisfied after performing a new habit to increase the odds that the behavior will be repeated next time. ‚ÄúThe human brain has evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.‚Äù For that, we can add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run.[Chapter 16] Here we learn how to measure our progress by tracking our habits. The immediate satisfaction it delivers‚Äîas mentioned earlier in Chapter 15‚Äîis one of the many benefits that standout. Besides that, James says, ‚Äúwhen we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path.‚Äù The most basic format to track our habits is to get a calendar and mark an X each time we stick with our routine. One of the most important passages of the entire book is as follows: ‚ÄúIf you miss one day, try to get back into it as quickly as possible. The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly.‚Äù[Chapter 17] In order to prevent bad habits and/or eliminate unhealthy behaviors, James says that we could either add an instant cost to the action or make it painful. A habit contract is also another strategy to hold our accountability: ‚ÄúIt is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don't follow through. Then you find one to two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you.‚Äù[Section VI : Advanced Techniques][Chapter 18] We learn how to distinguish habits when genes may or may not influence our performance especially for competitive activities. ‚ÄúOne of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills.‚Äù James proposes us to set some time apart to explore new activities in the beginning, before shifting our focus to exploit them thoroughly.[Chapter 19] When we find the sweet spot of our ability we tend to learn best and fastest. The ‚ÄòGoldilocks Rule‚Äô states that ""humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.‚Äù[Chapter 20] One downside of certain habits, James explains, is that we may stop paying attention to the little details and errors. To counterbalance that we should review and reflect on the process over time to remain conscious of our own performance. Using a simple chart to convey his message, we learn that ‚Äúthe process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.‚ÄùPERSONAL THOUGHTSReading the book twice helped me take better notes and capture details. In the meantime, I thought about 3 simple strategies that could improve our adherence to new habits. Let me share these strategies here with you, and in the following section, I will describe how I managed to cultivate the first 3 new habits upon reading the book‚Äîfollowing the system proposed by James together with these 3 strategies.[1] The first strategy is about determining a 'commitment time frame' to avoid excuses during this initial trial period. A 1-month time frame is a fair commitment, choosing to start on the first day of the month to practice it every single day for a full month. Just at the end of the period, I will take the time to reflect and evaluate the pros and cons.[2] The next one is to choose only 1 new habit each month. In doing so we become familiar with the practice intentionally while we develop a sense of purpose.[3] Last, during the first month of any new habit, I noticed that if I spend time exploring the details and the benefits, my motivation stays high. It doesn't only help us create better practices, but it is also inspiring to learn from others who have succeeded previously by adding the same habit into their lives. Podcasts, articles, videos, books, online courses, tutorials, and blog posts are all good sources.IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW HABITS[Nov 1, 2018] I had been wanting to journal on a daily basis for many years but that had never happened. Although I have carried a notebook with me for quite a while, it has never worked as a real journal‚Äîa daily routine, when we sit down and write personal thoughts, intentions, and reflections at around the same time. Instead, it has been mostly used to take notes during meetings, to write down ideas and thoughts, to express travel memories, and to doodle. Today, after 3+ months, I haven't looked back once, and still can't believe it took me that long to start this daily habit. During the first month, I read blog posts, watched videos, and even read a short and inexpensive book to foster my creativity.[Dec 1, 2018] I have been impressed by the physical capabilities we can develop through body movement. Although yoga has been a special part of my life since I was 18, I hadn't given proper attention to handstands. But now, after 2+ months practicing it every day, it is rewarding to see improvements on a weekly basis. Again, I definitely recommend watching videos and reading tutorials to find your favorite method. This is the perfect habit to stack at the end or in the middle of any physical movement practice you may enjoy.[Jan 1, 2019] By now we know the benefits of cold showers‚Äîranging from healthier skin appearance all the way to a more resilient perspective of the world. I had previously taken cold showers for 3 months in 2017, but it was a ‚Äúgoal‚Äù mindset instead of a ‚Äúhabit‚Äù mindset. After that trial I set aside and, although I have kept taking cold showers once or twice a week since then, I wished cold showers was the default mode. Now, after 1+ month, I can't see myself taking warm showers. After all, it is about intention. Again, we can learn uncountable benefits of cold showers by reading success stories. One of my inspirations was Wim Hof. It isn't comfortable in the beginning of any chosen day, but after 3-4 minutes, both my breath and thoughts calm down.Putting them together, these 3 habits don't take more than 30 minutes of my day. While I spend about 10 minutes journaling and 10 more minutes practicing handstands, I save 5 minutes taking cold showers because I won't stay any longer than necessary.RECOMMENDATION[1] First, if you have watched videos, listened to podcasts, read articles and books on habit formation and, after all that, you feel satisfied, then, please, save your money and time.[2] However, if you are like me, that even after reading a few books on building habits and having successfully added good habits to your life, feel that there is still room for improvement, this book can be a terrific addition.[3] Last, if you haven't spent much time and energy discovering a good system to build lasting habits while breaking bad ones, please, read this book.COMPLEMENTARY READINGS[1] Game Changers, by Dave Asprey, exposed me to a wealth array of ideas/habits/tools that have helped me decide which new habit to build next. The book is divided into 46 laws.[2] Essentialism, by Greg McKeown, helped me focus on less but more important tasks, giving clarity to what matters most. This is especially interesting to break bad habits.[3] The Talent Code, by Daniel Coyle, brought more motivation when learning new skills based on the assumptions that we develop new talents through deep practices, finding our ignition identity, and having the right coach to guide us genuinely. I read it many years ago, then, a few years back, I read his following book called The Little Book of Talent‚Äîwhich is perhaps even more to the point.[4] The Systems View of Life, by Fritjof Capra, enlightened my perspectives on how nature and living beings are systematically integrated.

I began this exploration with a hint of skepticism and concluded with an undeniable realization of its potential. ""Atomic Habits"" is not just another self-help book; it's a guide, a mentor, and a blueprint that ignited my drive for growth in ways I never foresaw.While it's nearly impeccable in its approach, there are a few nuances that could resonate differently with readers. Eager to provide an objective viewpoint, I'll dive into my thorough experience with this book, offering an insider's perspective on its profound layers. This review is packed with my praises, yet it also touches on areas where the content could be slightly refined for broader appeal.üñ•Ô∏èüìö **Detailed Strategy Over Mere Concepts**: A refreshing twist in self-help literature: At first read, it's evident that ""Atomic Habits"" isn‚Äôt just about abstract concepts. Instead, it offers actionable strategies, a pivot from the norm that significantly influenced my approach to habit formation. Its emphasis on the power of compound growth resonates deeply, bridging the gap between mere knowledge and its practical application.üí°üåô **Micro Changes, Macro Impacts**: Illuminating the potential of the minuscule: One of the standout features of the book is its emphasis on small changes leading to profound impacts over time. This concept is relatable, especially for those who've faced the daunting task of overhauling their lifestyles overnight. It‚Äôs these minor tweaks, consistently applied, that can shape destiny, a theme consistently echoed throughout the book.üìöüéí **Science Meets Anecdote**: A Blend of Research and Real-Life Stories: James Clear masterfully intertwines scientific research with personal anecdotes, painting a comprehensive picture of habit formation. This duality provides both a theoretical foundation and relatable stories, enhancing the book's credibility and readability.üï∂Ô∏èüñêÔ∏è **Crisp Presentation Coupled with Engaging Narration**: A Treat for Avid Readers: The coherent structure and lucid style of ""Atomic Habits"" are commendable. But the true gem is its captivating narrative, which ensures readers are glued from start to finish. It feels less like a study of habits and more like an enlightening conversation with a trusted friend.üîã‚è±Ô∏è **Sustained Motivation as the Central Theme**: The Powerhouse of Habitual Evolution: The recurring theme of maintaining motivation is a testament to the book's holistic approach. By focusing on systems over goals, it provides readers with a blueprint for long-term success, making transient motivation bursts a thing of the past.However, in the spirit of a well-rounded review, I'd like to touch upon a minor observation:‚öñÔ∏èü§î **Overemphasis on Certain Concepts**: Repetition for Reinforcement, or Redundancy?: While the recurring themes reinforce the book's core concepts, there are instances where certain ideas felt slightly overemphasized. While some readers might find this repetition helpful, others might see it as a tad redundant.Considering everything, ""Atomic Habits"" overwhelmingly earns its 5-star rating üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü. Any minor repetitiveness pales in comparison to the goldmine of insights this book offers. The meticulous research, relatable anecdotes, and actionable strategies make it a must-read.To all individuals eager for personal growth and those on the fence about diving into the realm of habits, I wholeheartedly endorse ""Atomic Habits"". It promises transformative insights and practical tools to craft a better version of oneself. After all, don't we all seek a life of improvement, one habit at a time?I extend my deepest thanks to you for investing your time in this comprehensive review. I trust it aids in your decision-making journey, drawing you a step closer to finding your perfect self-improvement guide. To a future enriched with continuous growth, one habit at a time.

96,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,Atomic Habits will change your life! 9 takeaways:,Mike Pritchard,5,"Atomic Habits by James Clear is one of those rare books that I immediately read twice in a row. It is filled with dozens of science-backed and actionable nuggets of wisdom. Do you want to improve any habits in your life? I heartily recommend Atomic Habits to you! We are all driven by our habits - many of which are unconscious. Below are 9 quotes and takeaways from this life-changing book:1. ""Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run."" Atomic Habits explains why the little things you do every day matters. Your little habits matter. It may not seem like a big deal to skip a workout or to be kind, but it is a big deal. Imagine if you improved your habits by only 1% every day. You'd be dramatically a different person in a year. Then imagine if you let your habits decline by 1% every day. You'd be in a much worse spot in life overall a year from now. Your little habits - atomic habits - count for a lot in the long run. What little habits are you improving upon (or neglecting...) today?2. ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."" This is such an important point in the book. Oftentimes we focus on goals in our life, while neglecting to focus on the systems that help us achieve goals. As an example, I had a friend who had the goal to complete a triathlon. He achieved this goal! And then he quit working out for the next year and got out of shape... He was so focused on achieving a goal that he neglected his underlying systems of being healthy. Goal achievement can actually set us back if we don't get set up sustainable systems. Get the systems right and then we'll indeed also achieve our goals. Systems > Goals.3. ""Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity."" I love this quote from the book. Every action - every habit - you take casts a vote for the type of person you want to become. Do you want to be a more organized person? When you develop habits and systems that organize your life, you are casting votes for thinking of yourself as an organized person. You think to yourself, ""hey, I'm an organized person."" And then you reinforce that belief with your habits and actions - a virtuous cycle! The flip side of this can be true too. What if you often show up late to meetings? You're casting votes that may make you think ""well, I'm just a person that is always late."" An un-virtuous cycle. Be careful to make sure that your habits and ultimately your beliefs cast votes for the type of person you want to become and, indeed, who you truly are.4. ""How long does it actually take to form a new habit? You just need to get your reps in."" Atomic Habits answers the question of ""how much time does it take to form a new habit"" with a better answer of : X number of actions. Meaning, you may need to simply complete a new habit 100 times for it to stick, which could be done in 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 months, depending on the new habit. It is better to think of forming new habits in terms of consistently taking action, versus trying to stick to a habit for just X number of days. Get your reps in.5. ""Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits."" The inverse of this is also true - increase friction between you and your bad habits! I think about this a lot when it comes to eating healthy. I need to reduce friction by having healthy food in the house and healthy snacks at work. And I need to increase friction by not having candy in the house or in my office! Out of sight, out of mind. In sight, and I eat it. :) (which of course reminds me of the Dad joke I often tell my girls: ""I'm on a seafood diet. I see food and I eat it...)6. ""Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do."" This is a powerful concept. I put this in practice by only ""watching TV"" when I'm on the treadmill. I am able to run at a 6 MPH pace and watch TV or videos on the iPad when I'm on a treadmill. So, I generally only watch sporting events or movies or 80s music videos on YouTube when I'm running on the treadmill. This approach actually allows me to run longer if I want to watch a full half of a game, for example. And 80s music videos will often give me the energy to run that extra mile. :) Think about a new habit you want to start and how you can bundle it with an action you're already taking. Stack them together - i.e. habit stacking.7. ""Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and 'don't break the chain.'"" Atomic Habits does a nice job of explaining the importance of tracking your habits for success. What gets measured gets managed. One of my favorite habit trackers is a FitBit/Apple Watch, which tracks steps, heart rate, sleep, weight and can even track food intake/calories, if you input this data. My behavior definitely changes thanks to these habit trackers. Atomic Habits gives you additional habit tracker resources.8. ""Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately."" We all will have days where we fall off the bandwagon and our habits go in reverse. Well, that's okay for one day. Don't let it happen twice. Get back on track as soon as possible. (And, yes, sometimes we miss a habit two days in row. Just don't let it become three days...)9. Author James Clear gets to the point quickly in Atomic Habits and with actionable advice. James has been blogging about habits, health, happiness, creativity and productivity since 2012. Check out a sampling of his writing at his website. James is also fun to follow on Twitter. Atomic Habits has 20 relatively short chapters that open with compelling stories and end with helpful chapter summaries. If you listen to books on Audible, I highly recommend the audio book as James reads this book very passionately.",TRUE,30-05-2019,"Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2019",735211299
97,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,"Huge toolkit of actionable, practical, organized strategies to build positive habits","Tom Venuto, Author of Burn the Fat, Feed The Muscle",5,"I've read a lot of books on changing behavior and building habits and James Clear's Atomic Habits is my new favorite. This book is different from others in the way it covers an enormous amount of ground in the larger area of self-improvement while seamlessly tying all these ideas back into the central theme of habits.One of the core concepts in Atomic Habits is to focus on the small improvement. The impact a 1% improvement per day can make may appear negligible at first, but Clear makes a compelling argument that in the case of habits, thinking small produces the biggest results over time. ""Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement,"" explains Clear.Over the months and years, the accumulated effect of small habitual daily behaviors is staggering. Early in the book we are also warned that this compounding works both ways, so we'd better make sure we're making it work in the positive direction, not for the negative.This is a concept I was introduced to years ago under a different name - Kaizen - the Japanese term for continuous incremental improvement. What's different and new in this book is how the concept is applied specifically to building habits.I found the information introduced in chapter two about behavior change at the identity level to be spot-on. You're also given a simple two-step process for changing your identity and this one idea alone is incredibly powerful.In chapter three, we are introduced to the habit loop - cue, craving, response, reward - and we learn how to build good habits in 4 simple steps and break bad habits in 4 simple steps.One of those steps to habit formation, which goes hand in hand with the 1% concept, is how to make it not only small, but easy. In the chapters that follow, this is exactly what you find out.Other ideas of great value that stood out included, habit stacking (the best way to form a new habit), habit tracking, habit shaping and how to design your environment - physical and social - for habit building success. You learn the truth about self-control, how to stop procrastinating and how to use implementation intentions, temptation bundling and motivational rituals. The book is simply packed with actionable ideas, tactics and strategies.Virtually every idea in the book is useful and resonated with me. While I may not agree that we should ""forget about goals,"" I agree with one of Clear's core principles in the book - that we must develop systems for change. If we only focus on goals and don't develop systems and a focus on the process, we risk falling into a number of goal-related traps which ultimately lead to stagnation. With the right systems, we're rewarded with continuous improvement on a lifelong journey of success.Another difference between Atomic Habits and other books in this genre is that while it's based on science it doesn't bog you down with unnecessary details of the research. Clear's book is intensely practical, giving you a huge toolkit of organized and named strategies you can apply immediately to create and strengthen positive habits and stop the negative ones.The book is conversational, and includes many interesting stories, making it easy to read - and hard to put down (I read it cover to cover in one day).It's possible this might become your most highlighted personal improvement book because every page is so chocked full of memorable and quotable gems of advice.",TRUE,16-10-2018,"Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2018",735211299
98,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,Distilled and clear ideas made into a simple system of behavior change. Top notch!,Andreas Aristidou,5,"I began reading this book with very high expectations and it did not disappoint. I, myself, am a big believer of the power of habits and have done a lot of research on the topic. Yet I learned a lot, especially the clarity with which the author presents his ideas. Big parts of the book were, in some sense, confirmation that I was doing things the right way, since I was oftentimes thinking ""oh yeah, that's similar to what I'm doing"". Still, parts of the book and strategies proposed were new to me and really helped add habit strategies to my toolbox. As mentioned though, the best thing about this book is the clarity with which the ideas are presented and the way they blend together.This quote from the last chapter summarizes the ""Four Laws of Behavior Change"" (that the book is about) well: "" (1) Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you'll need to make it obvious. (2) Other times you won't feel like starting and you'll need to make it attractive. (3) In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you'll need to make it easy. (4) And sometimes, you won't feel like sticking with it and you'll need to make it satisfying.""Here's some of the notes I made while reading the book:- Habits are like compound interest in self-improvement.- Outcomes are a lagging measure of habits.- The ""Valley of Disappointment"" is the period where you are putting in the hard work but still seeing no results. --> but remember, your work is not being wasted, it is being stored.- You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.- Your habits shape your identity and your identity shapes your habit. It's a feedback loop. (reverse causation for the nerds here)- Make clear plans - Use the ""Implementation Intention"": When X happens, then I will do Y OR if Z happens, then I will do W.- Use ""Habit Stacking"": After behavior X, I will immediately perform behavior Y OR If Z happens, I will immediately perform behavior W. (i.e. As soon as I begin boiling water for tea, I will do 10 burpees). Also, be very clear. (i.e. I will do the burpees next to the fridge in the kitchen, or whatever, you get the idea. As long as it works, it's good!)- People with high self-control are the ones who structure their environments in such a way to minimize exposure to tempting situations.- Use ""Temptation Bundling"" + ""Habit Stacking"": After X, i will Y. Right after Y, I will immediately Z,where X - habit I already do, Y - habit I need to do, Z - habit I want to do. (The anticipation of a reward is what gives us the most motivation - and not the reward itself.)- Do something you enjoy before a difficult habit.- Planning can sometimes be a form of procrastination because it can make you feel like you are making progress (while you are not).- Make your habits as easy as possible to start (i.e. do one set of abs, read one page of my book) - This is called a ""Gateway Habit"". and it helps to reinforce your identity of who you are which will itself help motivate you to keep going.- Prime your environment for future use - ""resetting your environment"" (i.e. Take out your coffee and mug the night before, make your bed perfectly, to remove the sense of sleep / bedroom if you'll be working from your bedroom)- Use pre-commitment devices to make it harder/ impossible to deviate from good habits.- Even one minute of a bad habit (i.e. checking instagram) can manifest into a lot (i.e. getting lost in time browsing instagram).- Put some immediate reward into good habits / immediate punishment to bad habits.- Create a habit tracker / calendar to provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation.- Rule: Never miss a habit twice! (life gets in the way, but don't let it derail you off your path)- Finding what you are naturally gifted in will make good habits easier. To do that ask the following questions. (1) What feels like fun to me but work to others? (2) What makes me lose track of time? (3) Where do I get greater returns than the average person? (4) What comes naturally to me?- You can also win by being different, by rewriting the rules (i.e. by combining your unique set of skills)- Periodic reflection and review can enable the long-term improvement of all habits - identity building.Finally, some quotes I liked:- ""Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.""- ""The greatest threat to success is not failure, but boredom.""- ""You have to fall in love with boredom.""- ""Improvement is not just about learning habits, it's also about fine-tuning them.""- ""Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.""And my favorite:- ""It is remarkable what you can build if you just don't stop.""",TRUE,26-04-2020,"Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2020",735211299
99,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,Clear + Practical SelfHelp Book For Those Wanting to Improve Productivity,Chauntel,5,"Atomic Habits, the brainchild of James Clear, is a powerful self-help book that promises to unlock your hidden potential and pave the way for transformative habits.

However, I'll give credit where it's due: this candor and authenticity may very well be a reflection of the book's original target audience and the author's personality.What sets Atomic Habits apart is the in-depth research that backs up every piece of advice.

Unlike other self-help books that leave you scratching your head, this one provides actionable steps that are simple to understand and implement. Clear's practical approach ensures that you won't be left wondering how to put these ideas into practice.What impressed me the most was the plethora of real-life examples scattered throughout the book. These stories of ordinary people achieving extraordinary results are inspiring and make the principles feel achievable. From the success of Olympic champions to the stories of regular folks, every anecdote brings the concepts to life.While the fitness-heavy focus might not resonate with everyone, it's essential to acknowledge that it remains true to the author's vision and persona. For fitness enthusiasts, this book will be a home run.In conclusion, Atomic Habits offers a refreshing take on cultivating life-changing habits. James Clear's wit and candor might not be for everyone, but the book's well-researched content, practical advice, and relatable examples make it a compelling read for anyone looking to improve themselves and their lives.

110,The 48 Laws of Power,A self defense weapon book that is NEEDED!,Jax Price,5,"The 48 Laws Of Power. Not sure where to really begin, but for people that say it is an ""evil"" book, you are taking it the wrong way. It is a powerful, self defense book NEEDED, because it literally teaches you how to deal with people out there in the world that are negative, toxic, liars, flatterers, fake, angry, suspicious, murderers and many more. To go into in depth detail of the book, here is how it is mainly summed up.You come across a Law. It says what it is. You then read a Transgression or Observance of the Law. Which these are real, historical stories that you will be reading. Some of these stories are cruel, fascinating, and overall jaw dropping. You'll find some of the worlds most recognized leaders and influencers in these stories.After you read these stories or the story, the Author gives you an Interpretation. Which is basically the breakdown or meaning of what the law was taking place in the story. After reading the interpretation once, I highly recommend going back to read the story again. This way, you'll gain an even more deeper understanding of the law.Lastly, the Author leaves you with an image, an authority (which this is a quote by someone) and a reversal. The reversal is basically the conclusion and tells you why you should follow the law.After you read a law, have a highlighter with you and go back to highlight some of the most important words or quotes. Trust me, A LOT of things will really stick out to you. Really reflect on your own past, personal experiences or situations you've been in with others. You want to do this, because it'll help make you stronger, wiser and more prepared than ever before when you come across any situation or person in the future, because YOU WILL. WE ALL WILL. And I strongly feel that this is why Robert Greene wrote The 48 Laws Of Power. Not just so you can be powerful or controlling over everyone, but mainly how you gain or use power against those who are very dangerous and want to purposely put you down into the ground.This book is NOT a toy. And don't just think that after you are done with the book, you can immediately just go out and start practicing all the 48 Laws. That is not how it works. It is your responsibility to know what situation you are in and to know what Law will be your bodyguard. Nevertheless, you should always be extremely careful of your own actions and the words that you are going to say. Power should never be underestimated. You must learn to handle it with care. If not handled carefully, its like letting loose a tiger out of its cage and its killing everyone in sight.Read at your own risk, but most importantly, LEARN....",TRUE,15-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2023",140280197
111,The 48 Laws of Power,DANGER: read at your own risk,J.S. Bach,4,"there seems to be a lot of love and hate surrounding this book, so if you are curious but unsure, this review should help you decide whether or not to buy the book, and how it will impact youFirst, to understand the 48 laws of power, you must know two key ideas1. you CAN NOT escape the power game. thinking you can ""not participate"" is as foolish as thinking that you could somehow escape gravity or make the sun stand still. Robert Greene explains why in the intro with some excellent examples2. the 48 laws of power are neither good nor evil; they are just LAWS. If someone pushed a man off a cliff would you blame gravity for for his demise? This is the mindset you must adopt in order to learn a lot from this book.Things I Liked- NEW PARADIGMafter reading the 48 laws, you will never see the world the same way again. once you understand some of these laws you will see many underlying currents and motives you did not see before.- INCREASES POWERone of the main reasons to buy the book. you wil become exponentially more powerfull by knowing and understanding these laws-CRYSTAL CLEARevery law is clearly outlined with ""transgression"" of the law, ""observance"" of the law, keys to power, and a ""reversal""-GREAT STORIESthe 48 laws are packed with mindblowing and sometimes humorous stories of people in history practicing these laws. this is helpful as some of the concepts are quite abstract.What I didn't like-RISKYan old proverb says "" A man who plays with snakes will eventually be bitten"". If you begin to use the 48 Laws improperly, you could get yourself in some dangerous situations, lose friends, piss off a lot a people, and destroy relationships- REQUIRES DISCERNMENTif you you are looking for a highly concrete book that the says ""do xyz and you will accomplish vyx"" look elsewhere. the Laws require good judgement and and and prospecting nature to practice and apply-NOT FOR EVERYONE If you are aghast at the idea of manipulation and deceit then read with caution.OVERALL: If you want to have more power or a better understanding of why different situations turn out the the way they do, you should definitely read the 48 laws of power by Robert Greene. If you want to be naive, easily manipulated, weak, you should ignore this book and go watch some netfilx.Thanks for reading",TRUE,15-11-2017,"Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2017",140280197
112,The 48 Laws of Power,Uncomfortable but important read!,Tsel Zagd,5,"I've heard about this book here and there but I haven't gotten around to check it out until 3 months ago. I was most intrigued when I heard that this book is/was allegedly banned in prisons due to its very powerful insights and tactics. So I pulled the trigger and purchased the book.With that being said, I think this is an essential read for every adult. Was it a pleasant read? Not necessarily. It explores the dark aspects of our human nature and how power is at play in every social interaction. A lot of the laws in this book didn't sit right with my personal values and it even made me uncomfortable at some points, but that is not the point of this book.

Before diving into its pages, I felt like my life was out of control, with challenges and setbacks lurking around every corner. However, this book has inspired me to take a new approach to life - to view my obstacles and enemies not as barriers, but as opportunities for growth and success.One of the most impactful takeaways for me was learning how to harness the power of my enemies. The author teaches us that having enemies isn't necessarily a bad thing - in fact, it can be quite beneficial. Our enemies can challenge us to be better, to work harder, and to reach higher. They can inspire us to be our best selves, even when we feel like giving up.Through real-life examples and powerful storytelling, this book illustrates the ways in which we can turn our enemies into allies. It provides practical tips and strategies for identifying and managing our enemies, as well as shifting our mindset to view them in a positive light.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to take control of their life and conquer their challenges.

130,Lessons in Chemistry: A Novel,Chemical Reaction Retraction,Crafty Consumer,4,"Much has been said about Bonnie Garmus's Lessons in Chemistry. So when my sister chose it for our book club, I was curious, albeit cautiously.Elizabeth Zott is a brilliant and beautiful chemist in mid-century California. She seems to have everything going for her, but ""seems"" is the operative word. Because the men she works with are awful. What's more, Elizabeth isn't like other women, or even people. Unflinchingly driven and uncompromising, she refuses to perform for anyone, to smile on demand or at all. She tells the truth, even when it's ugly -- and it often is --making her seem uncooperative, unlikeable, and cold to everyone but Nobel Prize-nominated fellow odd duck Calvin Evans. Yet at her core, Elizabeth is purely kind. Despite having suffered loss, violence, and the most egregious sexual discrimination imaginable, she believes that everyone deserves to be treated fairly. And it is this humanity that she brings to her cooking show, Supper at Six.Now, if you're wondering how a no-nonsense chemist became a TV star, then I'm right there with you. Suffice it to say that unjust events in Elizabeth's life resulted in this most unlikely of developments. And although she's less than thrilled to be working with bowls instead of beakers, she makes the show her own, taking every opportunity to educate her female audience about not just cooking but chemistry and, ultimately, change. Subversive and surprisingly entertaining, Supper at Six is a syndicated smash. To me, this is where Elizabeth blossoms, her paradoxically off-putting personality, passion for science and food, and insatiable hunger for justice commingling to enable her to connect with other women. It's exciting and inspiring and all of the things. But this is still Lessons in Chemistry, not an uplifting romp about a reluctant but charismatic performer. Because as I said in the beginning, Elizabeth Zott does not perform.There's trouble brewing at the TV station, just as there was at the lab, only worse. So some things happen, and then some more things, culminating in an ending that feels like a drop off a cliff. And although I can see how it would be satisfying for most, to me it's anticlimactic. Still, this isn't my story; it's Elizabeth Zott's. She's a scientist first and in the end, she gets what she wants and needs.Maybe understanding -- and respecting -- that is a lesson that this very unscientific but very feminist reader needed to learn.",TRUE,03-11-2023,"Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2023",038554734X

140,The Exchange: After The Firm (The Firm Series),"A fresh, exciting sequel to The Firm",Kelley Ridings,5,"Just a couple of weeks ago, I found out by chance that John Grisham had written a sequel to his first massive best seller, The Firm. I have read many of his books, with The Firm being my favorite. I just re-read it last year in fact. So becoming reacquainted with Mitch and Abbey McDeere again in The Exchange was incredibly unexpected and exciting.I used to be a huge Grisham fan and have read many of his books. But then I began to find his books had become stale and somewhat formulaic so I had stopped reading them. But in the last few years I did read one of his more recent ones (which was ok ‚Ä¶ not brilliant but ok), and I reread my two favorites of his (The Pelican Brief and The Firm). So, I was really pleasantly surprised that The Exchange was out.While I was cautious that it might be a letdown, it was absolutely not that. I was thoroughly engrossed in the story, much like I was with many of Grisham‚Äôs earlier books. He knows how to write a page-turner like no other writer I know. This book gets to a point where it‚Äôs hard to put down leaving the reader almost breathless while reaching the height of the story ‚Äî something he has done brilliantly time and again throughout his career. But this isn‚Äôt just a walk down the memory lane of the Grisham-of-old. He has updated the McDeeres into their early 40s (in 2006 so alas I am sure he is planning a third installment). So the McDeeres are not fresh young adults any longer. But John Grisham is not a fresh young writer any longer either. Instead he has matured his writing-style to make his legal thriller style even better.I am now a reinvigorated, eager fan of John Grisham again.

The idea of the sequel works well - throughout the book I was picturing a youthful Tom Cruise dashing around the world with Jeanne Tripplehorn, the supportive wife, holding down the fort at home. Could not really get the images out of my head. A sequel is a great marketing idea also because all of us who enjoyed the first book avidly buy the second. Thankfully it built on the past rather than continually rehashing The Firm. The book is pretty good. It does take a while to get going and does not start out as a page turner - the chapter endings are not cliff hangers, but by midway I was hooked and reading voraciously.

This sequel to The Firm, which I enjoyed re-reading in preparation (remembered none of it because I read that book as teenager), goes way way waaaaay out of the comfort zone. It was very international and very New York Upper-East side, with just a taste of the Memphis setting with what I thought would be a sub-plot that connected somehow, but it never panned out. It was still very good, very evocative, and I did enjoy it. It was my fault that I bought it with barely a glance at the synopsis, and I will do the same thing next year, without a doubt.

The story involves the abduction of one of Mitch's colleagues in Europe by a Middle East group of seeming terrorists. Mitch flies all over trying to negotiate and gather ransom money. Abby is also pulled into the fray. I'm not sure a sequel to THE FIRM was needed, but this story is interesting and different, with its international flavor.",TRUE,26-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2023",385548958
144,The Exchange: After The Firm (The Firm Series),Storyteller Extraordinaire - John Grisham,Roselady,5,"They're back ...... Mitch and Abby McDeere from ""The Firm"" return in this new tale by Grisham.The McDeeres are no longer naive new college grad's facing an uncertain future. They are now parents and seasoned world travelers who are now comfortably settled down in excellent jobs. Life is good, they are living the life they had always dreamt for themselves until.....Mitch is asked for assistance on a case by his good friend. What ensues can only be described as a living nightmare perpetrated by truly sick, insane people. Mitch and Abbys well ordered, comfortable life comes to a screeching halt, as do many others who survive the ordeal.Known for his legal battle books, this one took a twist that reads like a political, espionage/spy thriller. It was unexpected. Parts of the descriptive parts of this book gave me almost overwhelming feelings of nausea .... all to reminiscent of how I felt when I used to watch the news in the late 80's, 90's and early 2000's.....truly sick of what mankind does to each other in their respective searches for domination, greed, prestige and fame.That said, I read this book from cover to cover in one sitting because it certainly kept some of the when, where and how questions unanswered until the very end and because it was a book by John Grisham, a excellent writer and world class story teller.",TRUE,18-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2023",385548958

It's like the others, but unpredictable, so it was so much fun to read and I'm looking forward to reading it many more times. There's also a little ""Easter egg"" hidden on the page with the fireplace, and my daughters noticed it right away! I just saw stockings at first, but they knew! I don't want to spoil it for Mo Willems fans, so that's all I'll say. ;)And the ending really made me hopeful for another Pigeon book. I sure hope he'll write more, because we love them!It's another cute book, but what I love most about Mo Willems' books is that they're enjoyable no matter how old you are and they're educational. Toddlers love the silly characters and their lines, which they quickly memorize, and then that encourages them to read.One of my twins was reluctant to practice reading sometimes, but she was always in the mood for Pigeon or Elephant and Piggie books. They really helped with her confidence. Both of them started reading chapter books last year, but we'll always enjoy Mo Willems' books.

180,"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma",Buy this book!,"Tom Cloyd, MS MA",5,"Psychiatrist, professor, world-class researcher, and traumatologist Bessel van der Kolk MD requires no introduction to trauma psychotherapists. My enduring impressions of him over many years is one of relevance, cogency, frankness, and accessibility - served up with a subtle dash of impishness. He tends to be a bit disruptive - something of a provocateur - and everything of his I have ever read has taught me something, confirmed something important, or pushed my thinking in a new direction. When he has something to say, I want to hear it.However, I almost didn't buy this book: I was put off by the title. Familiar with major reviews of PTSD psychotherapy outcomes research, I know that research support for body-oriented approaches to treating psychological trauma psychopathology is thin at best, and such treatment models simply do not have the research validation of either EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) and PE (Prolonged Exposure), neither of which are especially body-focused.J. Interlandi's excellent article anticipating publication of this book - ""A Revolutionary Approach to Treating PTSD"" (New York Times Magazine, 2014.05.22 - available online) - initially supported my fears that for some inexplicable reason van der Kolk was now promoting some treatment model for which we have little confirming research. ""Psychomotor therapy is neither widely practiced nor supported by clinical studies,"" Interlandi informs us. Provocateur he may be, but I'm strongly biased in favor of paying attention to therapies for which we do have solid empirical validation. Our clients do not deserve to be experimental subjects - maybe not even if they agree to this, as I'm not sure they can ever know enough to make a truly informed consent. Knowledge that PTSD and related disorders are usually highly curable, when using the right treatment protocols, sadly remains the possession of a minority of people, even in the professional psychotherapy world.Yet the account of van der Kolk's therapy work in Interlandi's article is gripping. Becoming completely absorbed in the account, I was convinced. (I've been here before, reading van der Kolk's own accounts of his work.) And so the disruption begins! Deeper into the article, he has me. Van der Kolk's critique of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy - a general class of therapies) and PE (E. Foa's exposure therapy model) is withering and correct: neither really work. ""Trauma has nothing whatsoever to do with cognition...It has to do with your body being reset to interpret the world as a dangerous place....It's not something you can talk yourself out of."" Interlandi reports that ""That view places him on the fringes of the psychiatric mainstream.""But he's right, and I can't stress this enough. Why? Because as a trauma treatment professional I'm well aware of what the trauma treatment outcomes research actually says. The best current summary of this research well may be chapter 2 of Ecker, et al.'s (2012) ""Unlocking the emotional brain"". (Buy this book, too!) Ecker et al. brilliantly presents a synthetic summary that encompasses 11 existing therapy models which actually DO cure trauma psychopathology, if done right. In this context, what van der Kolk is doing makes perfect sense. Finally, it appears, the trauma psychotherapy field is moving toward a consensus which has strong credibility.Van der Kolk's new book has many virtues. Parts One and Two (102 pp) provide a substantial review of the neuropsychology of trauma's impact on a person. It's fun, interesting, informative reading, for professional and layperson alike. Part Three (64 pp) surveys childhood development, attachment experience, and ""the hidden epidemic of developmental trauma"". Van der Kolk has for years been a leading champion of the idea that there is a type of PTSD which substantially differs from all the rest. It develops in response to chronic child abuse and/or neglect. I completely share his belief that the diagnosis of Developmental Trauma Disorder (sometimes called C-PTSD, with ""C"" meaning ""Complex"") is overdue for formal recognition. I find his review of the struggle to legitimize DTD as gripping and distressing as anything else in the book. It is anguishing to know that a major problem exists, AND that the psychiatric establishment simply refuses to acknowledge it. DTD/C-PTSD is no fantasy. We see and treat these people, as children and adults. They exist, and they are nothing like ""ordinary"" PTSD treatment clients.Part Four (29 pp) focuses on memory. I've long thought that much writing on treating psychological trauma seems to miss the point: trauma memory is what causes the problem. Deal with that and the symptoms vanish. Why is this so hard to understand? Yet, it is not a common understanding at all. Explaining how trauma memory works is invariably enlightening to my clients. And experiencing what happens when we change the nature of trauma memory is revelatory to someone who's lived with it for years, if not decades. As he does throughout the book, van der Kolk offers fine stories about clients who have experienced exactly what I've seen happen in my clients, making excellent use of what cognitive research tells us: people understand things best through narratives. Offer a good narrative and you convince.Psychological trauma therapy is complex, but we are now well prepared to launch into the book's core content - Part Five (154 pp), ""Paths to Recovery"". He gets right to it: we cannot undo the trauma, but we CAN undo its effect on us, and so get our ""self"" back. Ch. 13 reviews existing therapies. His approach is to repair ""Descartes' Error"" (see Dam√°sio's 1994 book of that title) by viewing mind and body as a single coherent functional unit. His topical coverage is complete and his critique of current therapies acute - not to be missed.He then writes of the importance of language (Ch. 14). We construct our narrative mainly in words, and the words we choose are critical. But language is not enough (this anticipates his next two chapters). Our senses encompass a larger world, and it's center is our body, where all our sensory receptors are located. Then he introduces the treatment model he's long advocated: EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). I'm trained in EMDR, and in fact van der Kolk and I had the same instructor for our advanced training: Gerald Puk PhD. Van der Kolk tells an amusing and self-deprecating story about his advanced training experience, in which Puk was able to provide a strong corrective to his approach to clients. This is typical van der Kolk - he's a truth-teller, even when it may put him in a poor light! And,after all, at this point he has nothing to prove to anyone.Finding an EMDR therapist is not hard (see his ""Resources"" section). Nor is it hard to find a yoga instructor, and yoga is what he advises for helping a trauma victim get back into their body. Yoga is a wise choice, because it is available, already widely known, and adaptable to a wide range of individuals and capabilities.There is much more in Part Five, and the focus is on self-empowerment. ""Victim no more!"" as they say. Most trauma therapists have a keen interest in seeing their clients leave therapy charged up and ready to fully embrace their life - that certainly is my own emphasis. Van der Kolk's thoughts on self-empowerment for those in recovery from psychological trauma will be invaluable to any trauma psychotherapy client.For psychotherapy professionals, this book will be both delightful and confirming. For everyone else, it will be a readable, gripping, highly educational tour of topics all of which are critical to a successful transition back from the impact of psychological trauma. That he gives prominent though not dominating emphasis to developmental trauma disorders is entirely appropriate. Our society has yet to grasp that child abuse and neglect is a more often chronic than not, and that its impact is largely ignored and poorly treated, if at all. This does not have to be. Get educated (this book will do that), then commit to being an advocate for children as well as for adults impacted by trauma. They all deserve the chance to be healed, and we can now do that. Van der Kolk shows us how.The physical book: Jacket design is pleasant and interesting. Binding is less so: color of spine wrapping is semi-florescent, and of paper, not cloth. The book feels substantial and pleasant to hold and look at.Organization -* 6 pp: prefatory praise by peers and related luminaries (interesting comments from some important people in the field);* 2 pp: Table of Contents;* 356 pp: actual text;* 4 pp: Appendix: Consensus proposed criteria for developmental trauma disorder* 3 pp: Resources* 4 pp: Further reading* 51 pp: Notes* 21 pp: Index",TRUE,28-09-2014,"Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2014",143127748
181,"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma",Please buy this book and start loving your life,monsterpixel,5,"Of all the non-fiction books I've read, this is by far the best one ever. I grew up in a tough way. Lots went wrong. My brother and I believed we were unwanted and we had plenty of evidence to back up our sentiment. We suffered shared abuse and individual abuses of every kind imaginable. When I became an adult, I subscribe to the concepts of people like Rush Limbaugh and drove around listening to his radio show proclaiming that there is no such thing as post-traumatic stress disorder. I believed I could gut it out, that the past was the past and that only weak people needed to talk through their problems. I believed only losers behaved badly as adults due to anything in their childhood or past and that claiming you were affected by any past problem was a crutch to allow you to embrace failure. Frankly, for a time, that approach worked for me. I got married, had some great children (still have them thankfully), built a company. But it didn't take too long until it all came crashing down. And, when it did, I spent nearly 1.5 decades down. The anxiety that was always in my throat and chest was, to put it mildly, a distraction. It's very hard to be kind to people, to focus on your work, to love others when all your power is spent trying to pretend you don't feel like s***. When you can't sleep because your heart is beating so forcefully that the entire bed is vibrating - at least it feels that way - you not only lose the joy of sleep, but you feel hopeless and miserable and even more so when you're not able to understand why you feel this way. When you see everything you have go away and can only occasionally find the strength to take care of yourself and your business and need others in your life to carry you from time to time (much to your embarrassment) and yet you think you're smart and capable and have no understanding of why you are where you are, life becomes a slog. You trudge through it wishing you were dead or that something would kill you even if, like me, you'd never kill yourself. Literally, when I was a believer, I went to bed every night and my prayers went something like this, ""Dear Jesus, please have a bus run over me. I will never kill myself but I'm miserable. Please let me die so my family won't hate me for killing myself but so that I can stop hating the sun coming up. In Jesus name, Amen."" If you're like I was (and it's hard to tell you how I was and hold the tears down even now), this book will help you change all that. It will describe in detail what you're going through and it captures so many of those subtleties as to make it absolutely amazing. For the first time, I don't have depression (and I don't take pills). I don't have anxiety (it still bubbles up on occasion but using mindfulness, it goes nearly as fast as it comes). My life is pointed in the right direction, my business future is hopeful, my love-life is stabilizing, I know I'll no longer lose friends. I'm finally on track to getting what I want in every area of my life from women to money to friends and deep connections with my family. While I can't attribute every part of my success to this book alone as it takes many things to get where you want to go (mostly you), I can absolutely attest to the power of this book. If you've suffered any sort of major and/or persistent trauma in your life, please buy (and read) this book. You will one day thank yourself for doing so.",TRUE,24-09-2016,"Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2016",143127748

I have gotten better since I taught sixth grade science, but technical brain stuff still confuses me a bit. Thankfully, Bessel Van Der Kolk does his best to explain things so that even I can understand them. I may have needed to reread some paragraphs a couple of times, but I did finally understand it.The Body Keeps the Score is so well written. Like I said, even I was able to understand it. The writing style may be more technical, but it is still usually easy to understand. If you‚Äôre like me and know very little about the brain, you‚Äôll be good! He does a good job of explaining all the different parts of the brain and how trauma affects each of those parts.I learned a lot from the examples he shares of his clients and how they have reacted to traumatic experiences. It‚Äôs crazy how the same situation can cause such different reactions! In one person the experience can cause the person‚Äôs brain to pretty much shut down, while someone else‚Äôs brain in the same experience can cause more of a fight or flight response. I did find it fascinating to learn about these different responses.One of the reasons I‚Äôm glad I read The Body Keeps the Score is so that I will be better prepared and be better able to help my friends, family members, and students who have suffered from traumatic experiences. One of my favorite parts was learning about all the different strategies that can be used to help people heal from their trauma. I knew about a few of them, but I learned about several unconventional methods that will help.I love that healing focuses on body awareness and mindfulness. It‚Äôs all about separating the past and the present and becoming aware of your body. It seems strange, but apparently when you suffer from a traumatic experience, your past and present collide. When something triggers your mind in the present, you feel the same emotions as you did when you first had the experience. At that point it becomes difficult to discern if you are in the present or in the past. Fascinating, right?Content Rating: PG-Profanity: None-Intimacy: Low (Incest and abuse are noted as causing trauma.)-Violence: Low (He does describe some traumatic experiences his clients have experienced.)Age Recommendation: 16+ (It‚Äôs quite technical and younger readers may not fully understand the content or be able to apply the knowledge.

187,"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma",DO NOT READ THE EPILOGUE TO THIS BOOK. IT COMPLETELY RUINS THE BOOK!!!!,Amazon Customer,4,"I want to give this book 3.5 stars, but because I think the knowledge in this book is important for the average person to read, I‚Äôll give it 4 stars. I want to preface that the epilogue to this book (‚ÄúChoices to be Made‚Äù) is an absolute trash-ridden, garage-filled piece of detritus that doesn‚Äôt belong anywhere in any sort of literature. It almost convinced me that this author is an absolute shill. However, if one ignores that entire last chapter, then the book itself is actually quite superb (and the author doesn‚Äôt seem to be a fraud).Trauma is a huge problem in the world. Many subjects in the modern era have really advanced in order to better understand the human brain, mind, and the processes connecting them (mainly due to technological advancements such as the fMRI). I would think that to most people, trauma is something that can detrimentally, and sometimes irreversibly, harm someone. If that someone is a child, this damage is multiplied by a billion. However, what I think that people end up lacking is the knowledge of when/how trauma can form. It isn‚Äôt just caused by obvious phenomena such as war, natural disasters, tragic family accidents. It can be caused by simple things as well such as verbal arguments, falling off a bike as a child, or a parent working long hours and never seeing his or her child. This is why this book is important. It makes it known that trauma is a lot (or can be a lot) more ubiquitous than people think.The book is broken down into a few sections. I would say about 70% of this book is background, on a variety of subject matter. This certainly could have been shortened down by about 40%, but I suppose more information is generally better (in this case I would likely disagree, as the book itself is already too long, so removing the ‚Äúfluff‚Äù would likely have been a good idea). The last 30% of the book is about ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù to trauma. I won‚Äôt go into each chapter and mention every main point, but overall each chapter is worth, at the very least, a heavy skimThe background knowledge on trauma is really interesting. We learn what parts of the brain are activated during trauma (and parts that are activated post-trauma). This help us to understand why people may ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù during a traumatic experience, why people cant express their feelings when they become ‚Äútriggered‚Äù, and why certain medications work better than others. The information here really opened my eyes as to why people who have experienced trauma can act so strangely and illogically. ‚ÄúJust tell me what emotion you are feeling.‚Äù ‚ÄúStop trying to hit me! What the hell do you think you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù I feel like I can sympathize more with these people and have a better understanding of how to approach them.The solutions to this were quite impressive and honestly seemed fairly simple in nature. Examples include EMDR (which is essentially just a mixture of hypnosis and REM sleep initiation), brain-computer interface technology to control frequencies produced by your brain, talking, yoga, theater, etc. There is no cure-all method, but rather each solution needs to be tailored to each individual. Obviously, drugs are an option here but this merely is a temporary solution and doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúfix‚Äù trauma at all.I want to finish this with my negative opinions on this book and the author. Overall, the author seems to be fairly knowledgeable and truly caring. However, this book is full of their bias, and it really shows. A few examples are as follows. The author does a good job at adding references in this book when making claims, but when you pay attention to the location of the references, it is clear that the author is tacitly picking and choosing what they need to reference. For one, the author really hates drugs (and by that I mean medications used to treat people with mental disorders or trauma). He makes that very clear throughout this entire book. So he will reference some statistics that say drug use is bad when he makes a claim. But then a few sentences later he makes another claim that negatively talks about drugs, but doesn‚Äôt cite any reference. He tries to make you think that the reference 3 sentences ago would also be for this, but in reality it doesn‚Äôt. I see this as pseudo-science. He thinks he is being clever but in reality he is just being a biased con artist and not even close to a real scientist. As I mentioned early, the epilogue to this book is just atrocious, This is where he gets into politics and tries to tie trauma to all sort of institutions and societal structures. He blames trauma on guns, healthcare, teachers, etc. He think that teachers are to blame (they dont comfort kids enough) and writes off the parents bad behavior at home as ‚Äúsomething that happens, but the teacher needs to be the ‚Äòparent‚Äô then‚Äù. He paints the USA at times as some crazy country where schools and healthcare is years behind what it should be, but doesn‚Äôt talk about these same exact issues (sometimes even worse) in Western Europe where these political structures are different, but the problem still remains. I‚Äôm very happy this was an epilogue and not an introduction because if it was I would have thrown this book into my compost bin immediately if it was.",TRUE,16-03-2021,"Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2021",143127748

190,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 1)",Bow Down to the Queen of YA Fantasy,Teisha @ Girl Writes Reviews,5,"This book, with its magic, fairytale roots, and steamy hot romance, deserves ALL of the stars. I loved it!Here are the five reasons why I gave A Court of Thorns and Roses 5 out of 5 stars (and then some):‚òÖ FAIRYTALE RETELLINGI was a little wary of this story when I discovered that it was a fairytale retelling. I love the story of Beauty and the Beast. Growing up, I watched the Disney version all of the time (but not as much as I watched Pocahontas). However, in the past I have struggled to find enjoyment in Beauty and the Beast retellings. Particularly Beastly by Alex Flinn -- I did not enjoy the book or the movie.I think I was worried that A Court of Thorns and Roses wouldn't feel original, but it was the complete opposite. Maas has written an incredibly unique story that is grounded in the fairytale we all know and love, but is also independent and utter creative genius (Maas is definitely honing and owning her writing skills!). Yes, there is a curse, and magic, and a love story. But there is also dark magic, and steamy romance (and I do mean steamy!), and blood and gore, and court drama -- basically, all of my favorite things wrapped up in one neat, rose-colored bow.There were some twists on the original story of Beauty and the Beast that I really enjoyed. For example, in the original story, the residents/servants of the Beast's home are cursed and transformed into household items. However in ACOTAR, rather than being transformed into household items, Maas' cursed characters must wear masquerade masks, and have done so for 50 years since the curse was placed on the night of a masquerade party. I also appreciated that, though Tamlin was a beast, that quality did not factor into the curse that was placed on him. Rather, as a Fae, he has the power of shape-shifting, and takes the form of a beast (usually when fighting). So, throughout most of the book, Tamlin is portrayed as a glorious, chiseled, man of steel. Some readers believe that the fact that Tamlin is gorgeous retracts from the Beauty and the ""Beast"" story line. However, no one writes hot male love interests like Sarah J. Maas, so I am not complaining about Tamlin at all.Overall, I found that I loved the fairytale background of this story more than anything. I enjoyed drawing comparisons between Maas' story and characters, and the story I grew up with. Maas' world is so intriguing, engrossing you from the very beginning and never letting you go.‚òÖ GENREWhile we know that ACOTAR is a fairytale retelling, that is not to say that it is a children's book. I went into this book thinking that it was Young Adult. However, there is a particular scene that takes place after the Great Rite on Fire Night (such a good scene, by the way -- just wait for it) that made me take a step back and think ""Whoa! This is way too sexy and erotic for Young Adult literature.""Looking back at Goodreads, I found that the book was listed as Young Adult and New Adult. But, I would personally classify this book as New Adult. Having read many New Adult novels, I found that the sex rating for ACOTAR resonates with that of a New Adult novel. I think that there is a lot of confusion about the genre of this book because we all know Sarah J. Maas as a Young Adult author. I personally have no problem with this genre. However, for parents who are giving this book to their young children, or for those readers who don't enjoy sex scenes in their books -- you have been warned.I love the New Adult genre, and discovering that ACOTAR fell into that genre made me love it even more. I appreciate the more mature content, and that the characters are closer to my age (Feyre is 19). And, hey, I appreciate the sexy times, too. (There is no shame in my game... Because, who am I kidding? I have no game.) I had also never read a New Adult Fantasy before, so I was glad to be exploring new territory.I'm absolutely impressed with Maas as a writer. She is not afraid to be different, to venture out to new places. I love that she is entering this new genre, and look forward to seeing what else she has up her sleeve for the future.‚òÖ FEYRE, THE PROTAGONISTWhen I started reading ACOTAR, I was sure Maas was going to give us another Celaena Sardothien: a badass girl who is nearly invincible, yet lovable and cool. However, Feye (pronounced Fay-ruh) is so different from other fantasy protagonists I have read, because she is so unapologetically human. She is normal, and she is flawed, and I found that I could easily relate to her character. Feyre is unlike the female protagonists we are accustomed to. She is no fighter, not outstandingly gorgeous, and she is also illiterate (a shortcoming that embarrasses her to not end).In the beginning, Feyre is not very likable. She is cold, harsh, stubborn, and hard-headed. But, readers begin to see how her situation of poverty has shaped her to be that way. Once at the Spring Court, where she is no longer burdened with the responsibility of taking care of her father and two sisters (all of whom are ungrateful of her efforts to keep them alive), the ice in her heart begins to melt as she lives in comfort and takes up her passion for painting. Readers witness her character develop as she begins to rediscover happiness and life's simple pleasures. Feyre easily becomes a character you can't help but root for and love.‚òÖ TAMLIN & AN IMPENDING LOVE TRIANGLESince we have discussed Feyre, I believe that it is only appropriate to take a glance at her love interest: Tamlin.Tamlin is a bae Fae warrior, with magical abilities. He is also gorgeous, kind-hearted, and strong. And, he places Feyre's happiness and well-being above all else. But, he is not perfect. He is flawed, haunted by his family's past, by his own mistakes, and the lives he has taken. But, through all of that, he still strives to do and be good.However, I admit that while I love Tamlin, I am worried that Maas has a love triangle in the works for Book 2 of ACOTAR.Because Rhysand.Rhys, a sexy, dangerous Fae, is a force of nature who seeks to dig his claws (or rather, talons) into Feyre. And, I can't say that I hate him. I actually like his character, although we witness him do some terrible things (even to Feyre). He seems edgy, fun, and is incredibly witty. (Maas does this thing where she makes you fall in love with all of her characters, even the morally ambiguous ones.) While Tamlin is all gorgeous and good, Rhys has that hot-but-tragic thing going for him.I am already struggling with the love square Maas has going on in the Throne of Glass series (between Celaena and her three love interests -- Chaol, Dorian, and Rowan). I don't think that I will be able to handle the emotional roller coaster of another of her love triangles. But, I think that as long as no one else is introduced, as long as this does not move into the quadrilateral stage, everything will be fine.‚òÖ SUPPORTING CHARACTERSWhile Maas' main characters are at the center of attention, her supporting characters keep this book afloat. With less focus and fewer appearances, Maas' supporting characters still manage to steal our hearts and the show.First, there is Lucien, the red-haired, one-eyed Fae who is Tamlin's best friend. He is initially rude to Feyre, but eventually warms up to her. They easily develop a sort of big-brother-little-sister relationship. I would consider Lucien to be the story's comic relief. He is humorous and sarcastic and I adore his character.There is also Amarantha, the story's evil villainess. She is a Fae ruler who has a particular hatred for humans, which is not good for Feyre. She is cold, calculating, and cruel. But she has a backstory (all the best villains have backstories). And, I don't want to spoil you all, so I will just say that, when you learn her backstory, you realize why Amarantha is so harsh and unforgiving. Although, while I can sympathize with her on some level, I find her evil ways to be too much at times. However, I still find her to be an interesting, well-written character.And of course, there is Rhysand, whom I mentioned earlier. He is incredibly important to the story of Book 1, and will have an even larger presence in Book 2. I cannot wait to learn more about his character, because he is so enigmatic and intriguing and I just know that I am going to love him.HONORABLE MENTIONSMaas' WritingI believe that ACOTAR is Maas' at her best. As I stated earlier, we are definitely seeing Maas hone and perfect her skill -- each book she releases is always better than the last. What I liked most about Maas' writing in ACOTAR was her use of first person. Throne of Glass is written in third person, and with changing character perspectives. I find that I can tend to get bored with certain characters. But, with ACOTAR, told from Feyre's perspective, I felt engaged throughout the entire book.Faerie WorldI literally want to live in Prythian, in the world of the Fae that exists beyond The Wall (just without all of the drama). Maas depicts the Spring Court so beautifully and vividly. It seems like a literal heaven on earth.Other than the beauty of the Fae world, there are the parties and festivities. I mentioned Fire Night and the Great Rite earlier, two very interesting festivities held in the Fae world. And then there are parties and gatherings celebrating the seasons, such as Summer Solstice and Midsummer. It is all so fantastical and fun, readers are just dying to step into the pages.***There is not much else I can say about A Court of Thorns and Roses. I LOVED this book! I have no idea how I am going to wait an entire year for the sequel. It's going to be excruciating, but I am sure that it is going to worth it. Because Sarah J. Maas is a fabulous queen of writing, and every word she writes turns to gold.",TRUE,05-10-2015,"Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2015",1635575567
191,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 1)","Not a perfect book, but a good book 1.",Kindle Customer,5,"I bought the trilogy. All together they were the best books I've read in a while. Separately, they were not perfect but I'm okay with that. I read a lot and tend to dislike books that show no character growth, or have wishy-washy villains, or have insta-love, or have love result from H saving h from sexual violation, or suffer from deus ex machina. I don't particularly care if something is obvious because sometimes I want to read something that is easy and obvious. My brain doesn't want to be challenged 24/7. Also, I love good dialogue- dialogue makes a romantic connection feel real rather than insta-lovey. Is dialogue action-packed? No. Does it slow down pacing? You bet. At this point, you're probably wondering where this review is going? Well, I think that knowing more about me as a reader might make it easier to see/ relate to my views for this book.Now the fun stuff! ***SPOILERS***Feyre (the h):This character is complex and goes through several changes throughout the series. In this book, she has her ups and downs. Initially, she is hardened, street-smart and capable with a cynical eye toward romance and happiness and outright hatred and prejudice towards the fae. She also has love for a family who seems to dislike and neglect her. She is not very likeable. But does that make a book bad? No. (Hello, Wuthering Heights.) It is, however, more rare to write an h this way because readers in general tend to want to relate to an h, particularly when it's written in 1st person perspective. So many readers might not be able to get into the story because of their dislike for Feyre. When the far remove her burdens that largely drove who she was, Feyre changes. She doesn't have a purpose to keep her going, to shape her. The pacing of the book suffers a bit here while she tries to sort herself out. She tries to make love and painting her new purposes, and while she has the determination to do so, the fit just isn't right. Does this make the book bad? No. While many people won't like to read about an h that seems somehow ""less"" this downward arc was necessary to fuel the inevitable reversal toward a more fitting purpose. It drags a bit for sure, but makes the reversal feel more right, more true later on. Did she rush into something with Tamlin. Her feelings do feel a bit rushed but ultimately fit her as a character- going all-in has always been her style from the start. In that sense, the character is consistent. Also, her reluctance to voice her love made me think that deep-down she might have confused love with gratitude. Tamlin was her savior in many ways. For all of these reasons I liked Feyre.Tamlin (the H):Tamlin was the 1st high fae Feyre had any meaningful interactions with in the 1st book. I never really liked him as an H. He was pretty but basically hollow. He struggles with uncontrolled rage. He had just as much hatred for humans as Feyre did for fae, and his elitist attitude was hinted at throughout this book (though not substantiated until book 2). He also adheres to fae tradition in weird ways- his willing participation in the Fire Night ritual is distasteful because it borders on infidelity (especially since we later learn in book 2 that he can designate a replacement). Tamlin has from the beginning been primarily focused on Tamlin. When things get tough, he sends Feyre away; he doesn't consult or listen to her, but just decides, hinting at his desire to treat her like a possession rather than a person. When he gets a moment of freedom under the mountain he attempts to have sex with Feyre (his wants) instead of trying to escape with or save her (her needs). When Feyre is dying, he can only bring himself to beg for her life, he isn't moved into action. All of these things hint that Tamlin is not a good fit for Feyre. Many readers will not like to read about an H that is so lacking/ ill-fitted. The beautiful part is that these things are only ever hinted at in the writing, not outright stated so you will want to root for Tamlin while also feeling something inexplicably lacking in him. I thought about it lots before I picked up book 2, where my thoughts regarding Tamlin were cemented. Tamlin could not have been written more likeable though. If he was the perfect H then Feyre falling for Rhys in book 2 would have felt like a betrayal, instead of fated, and then Feyre would've been worse than unlikable but detestable as an h.Lucian:A secondary character who is both interesting and flawed. He hates Feyre at first, but ultimately warms up to her. He is loyal to a fault, siding with Tamlin over and again, even when he thinks it is wrong to do so. A trait that becomes more obvious as the series progresses. Lucian has potential.Rhysand (villain/other H):Rhysand was the most interesting character in the book (although Nesta was a close second). Rhys was the evil queen's right-hand man. He has done terrible things. Yet, when we meet him (not my favorite bit of the book because of the gross circumstances I do not favor, as mentioned above) there is evidence that he is not all that he seems. He appeared to be interested in Feyre romantically, but the ""why"" part is not there. Also, it is not 100% certain WHAT drives his actions. He is a mystery. Why did he decide to help her time and again? Why, if he likes her did he decide to put her through nightly humiliation? Why use her to torment Tamlin? He is clearly not 100% a good guy. He is complex.Other things people often talk about:The sex. There is a lot more sex in this book than in other ""YA"" books. It seems like that has somehow lead to some amount of controversy. I find that notion very strange as many eons ago when I was a teen, sex was a big part of being a teen- whether or not to have it, who had it, when they had it where and how, what type of birth control to use, etc. Suggestions that a book would have any type of influence on those things are just silly. Teens have sex. It's a fact. Wishing it otherwise does nothing productive. Also, the sex in this series is not ""explicit."" Every time I see this adjective used, it makes me laugh. I have read many romances and even some erotica. If you truly want something ""explicit"" check out erotica- phrases like ""the apex of my thighs"" or the ""the length of him"" are not ""explicit.""The copious dialogue. Lots of readers don't like the extended dialogue and also wish to have seen more of the fae world. I am just guessing here, but I am thinking that they are meaning that they wanted less talk and more fairy magic. But, fae are known for more than just their magic. Another key attribute of fae has to do with their words- being able to only speak in rhyme, only speak the truth, answer any question posed, etc. This attribute can be very interesting (see Mortal Instruments series or Dresden Files). And indeed it was put to use throughout the series, sometimes well done other times much too dues ex machina for my liking. Dialogue can be a type of action when done well enough. In this book, it probably could've been better but was good enough for me.The Fire Night and rape culture. Honestly, I am bothered by this one. I am never fond of rape or sexual violence as a plot device which is why I tend to avoid historical romances almost entirely. In this book, I think the Fire Nite ritual was used in part explain a bit about fae magic and in part to push forward the Feyre-Tamlin relationship while introducing Rhys. I think it both went too far and not far enough. Tamlin's participation cheapens his feelings toward Feyre, just imagine someone saying, ""I love you, truly, but I need to go have sex with someone else."" And then he came back to Feyre AFTER HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE ELSE, and bit her to clearly show his possession of her. It doesn't sit well, does it? Additionally, the three fae with bad intentions suggest to Feyre that fae tradition gives them the right to violate her just because she is present. That makes all fae seem brutal and detestable. Thus, it goes too far. But, what about the converse? The Fire Night ritual is supposed to be necessary to ensure the bounty of the land for the next year. But, the spring court is the only court that has/ observes this ritual en mass? That does not really make sense to me. The need for this ritual, especially considering mated bonds are a rare and extremely valued thing, is not properly explained. It really could've been omitted from the book and is one of the few things about the book that I truly did not like.The masks. Some people like them, some don't. The reason given for them was that they were yet another obstacle to a human girl falling in love with Tamlin. I really didn't mind them but I did not like Feyre's reaction to the removal of the masks. While it was consistent with her character (she always had an eye for pretty guys), I thought that it cheapened her character to have her feel relieved that Tamlin was so pretty without his mask. It was very superficial, and further proof that there wasn't much of substance to their ""love.""While book 1 is my least favorite of the series, I still really liked it and will definitely re-read it again. Books 2 and 3 get even better and I am looking forward to further writings as well. Hopefully we will get to see what happens to Nesta, Elaine, the 6th queen, and Bryaxis.",TRUE,02-10-2017,"Reviewed in the United States October 2, 2017",1635575567

193,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 1)",Beautiful Cover,Ohlookabunny,4,"Having heard much raving about this series, I was poking around on Amazon when I saw this collector's edition. It is indeed gorgeous, although I do wish it had a ribbon attached to the book to use for a bookmark. The gold image that flows from the front cover to the back and the texture of the cover are far more appealing than the plain, paper, black covers that are on most hardbacks today, and that alone justifies its presence on the shelf. It wasn't the first time I had bought a book for the cover.Aside from hearing reviews from fans, I also saw a reference to the book when reading about Patricia A McKillip's _Winter Rose_, which I had recently read, and its connection to the ballad of Tam Lin. This same fairy tale apparently had influence on Holly Black's _Tithe_, also. Although the High Lord in Maas's tale is named Tamlin, the story is obviously a retelling of ""Beauty and the Beast."" The story also has borrowed pages from the fairy tale ""East of the Sun, West of the Moon,"" wherein the main character is taken away from her family by the bear, and the bear prince makes her impoverished family rich. Whereas neither ""Beauty and the Beast"" nor ""East of the Sun, West of the Moon"" have fairy characters, aside from a witch or enchantress here and there, in the story Tam Lin, he is identified as an elf. In Maas's retelling, which court is cursed to wear masks, Tamlin's friend's mask is clearly stated as a fox, whereas Tamlin's mask is only vaguely described, and he is often referred to as a ""beast."" The lack of description was a tad infuriating.While set in a fairy tale period of time past, the main character clearly has ""modern"" ideas. She has no mother and a weak father figure and, furthermore, was tasked by her dying mother to take care of her sisters, despite the fact that she is the youngest. The family has only recently fallen into poverty, and the main character's upbringing has been neglected. She learns to hunt to feed the family, and, unlike the book-loving Belle of the Disney fairy tale, no one bothers to teach her how to read, although she is presented with a library, at which point, if you were ever in doubt as to which fairy tale was being emulated, you now know for sure. According to the Internet, the character's name ""Feyre"" means ""Fair, Beautiful,"" like the name ""Belle."" DYSWSDT? I myself am not a fan of retellings, and even less of ""modern"" retellings, although I do appreciate influences and notes here and there.As a novel, the story has a single plot line. I have always felt that a story can be a single plot line told in a linear fashion, but a novel requires a bit more substance. Although it was interesting enough for me to finish, I am not sure that I feel compelled to read the rest of the series, particularly if there is no matching collector's edition. For me, the most interesting parts were the three tasks at the end, and I had already guessed the answer to the riddle. I found Feyre's modernity and rebellion to be tiresome and in direct contrast to what readers who like fairy tales would desire, and I found her difficult to like, which is basically how I feel about most ""strong female characters."" I do not understand how a person who is stubborn and illogical is strong. Stubborn, I can get. Stubborn and dumb at the same time? No.ACOTAR has a Lexile score of 880, which puts it at the lower end of a 4th grade reading level (700-1160). You won't learn any new big words, and the prose is clearly more commercial than literary and follows the ""hero's journey"" template little to no deviation (i.e., no big surprises). It is known near the beginning of the book that the main character is no virgin, and there are racy scenes past the middle of the book, as well as being intoxicated and hints of something like a lap dance while being scantily clad in later chapters. The descriptions of the fairy land (not merely a realm) were not as detailed as those in Julie Kagawa's _The Iron Fey_ series and were mundane and too similar to the lands of the mortals. The writing was a bit awkward at several points where one character's actions were in the same paragraph with another character's dialogue, so there was a bit of a whiplash effect for the reader, and the book could have used a good editor to clean up those areas. So, was it bad? Obviously not that bad, since I finished it. Will I read more of her stories? I can't say for sure, but probably not unless they issue an attractive collector's edition worthy of the bookshelf. It satisfied my curiosity, but for Fey-related books, I recommend Jim Butcher's Dresden Series and Julie Kagawa's Iron Fey Series. Both have mind-blowing descriptions and intricacies. I'm always interested to read other authors and series that would do a better job on this topic just to see if it's possible. So, I gave it three stars for being ""okay"" plus one for a really nice cover.",TRUE,19-07-2023,"Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2023",1635575567
194,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 1)",Glad I finally started ACOTAR,BooksAreMyTherapy,5,"I'd had this series on my TBR for ages. ""A Court of Thorns and Roses"" burst onto the scene a good eight years ago and hasn't let up on Instagram and TikTok, like that friend who's always the center of attention. Let me be clear: fantasy isn't usually my cup of tea, but the incessant chatter about these books made me feel like I was missing out. So, I finally embarked on ACOTAR, and it was a slow start, to say the least. I'd read a bit, then it would gather dust for days, weeks, and sometimes months. World-building felt a bit like trying to join a conversation in a foreign language - bewildering.Around the two-thirds mark, though, the book finally caught my interest. The story took a turn for the better, but then it seemed like the book was about to conclude, and yet it carried on‚Ä¶and on. All said, the writing in this book is truly impressive. The characters are finely detailed and genuinely engaging. At its core, the story is a sort of Beauty and the Beast reinterpretation. But let's be clear, this is no standard fairy tale. After Beauty falls for the Beast, there's a lot more in store. The Beast has hidden depths, and Belle isn't your typical Disney princess. I now get why folks adore this series. I'm currently immersed in the second book, and it's progressing at a brisk pace. Everything's set up, and I'm beginning to feel like I've joined the ranks. With excitement and a cup of coffee in hand, I'm eagerly anticipating the adventures that await in the rest of the series.

196,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 1)",ACOTAR is nothing more than erotica,Anne Pruitt,2,"So here I sit, having gone through the OMG ACOTAR SERIES IS AMAZING phase, and out the other end, I can sit back and think ""What the actual hell?""I'm a HUGE Maas fan, so when I found out she was writing another series, I had to have it. For the first time in a long time, my library actually got the book within a month of its release, so I checked out ACOTAR and read it in a single day. I loved it.Books two came out, and while I was super disappointed in the pointless sex thrown in every so often and whole chapters dedicated to this nonsense, I continued reading because the story was compelling enough. And then ACOWAR emerged, and everything changed.This was a series I read numerous times before ACOWAR came out, and I saw things that genuinely bothered me, but I ignored them (I don't even know why) until I just couldn't stand it anymore.ACOTAR is nothing more than erotica. I feel like the series as a whole started out with plans of being some sort of ""story"" porn that has a kick-ass plot with ""hot"" scenes thrown in for whatever reason, and then it got to ACOWAR and decided it wanted to be The Bachelor or a soap opera instead.The relationship between Tamlin and Feyre GREATLY disturbs me. She's taking care of her family and he swoops in after she accidentally kills a fae (who was disguised as a wolf int he woods where hunters hunt...) and takes her away, claiming she's going to be in trouble and damned and blah blah. No, she's pampered and given servants and pretty clothes and good food. Tamlin dresses her up like a doll and makes snide remarks when she falls short of his goals (fae goals, mind you).Feyre is a HUMAN. Tamlin is fae. He acts like her humanity is a curse or something to hold against her, and he constantly makes remarks about how she's too fragile, too uneducated, too plain, etc. Instead of ""fixing"" these issues, Tamlin does nothing other than tell her what to do and not do.He sexually assaults her after Calanmai, and in the book Feyre shows how much she does not want his advances, and he shoves her against the wall and BITES her, then tells her not to ever go against him again. How is this OK? If my husband ever did this to me, I'd kick him in the crotch and leave. This is not OK. This is not a relationship. This is abuse, which is why it disgusts me that people go on and on about Tamlin.The fact that Feyre and Tamlin have sex at a later time after he did this makes it worse. why, Feyre, are you going to throw yourself at a man who A) Doesn't care about you based off his degrading comments and B) threatens you. Not only that, he basically blames her for a near-rape experience when he literally did nothing to look out for her and/or stop the guys who were going to attack her?That being said, I have a lot of issues with Feyre. She gets off too easy on everything, and it's like her brain is only wired to care if the dude is hot. You take care of your family, but then you walk into Tamlin's embrace after the things he has said and done. I understand she has been abused by this, but at the same time, she could have said no. Death is a lot better than basically being a sex slave or punching bag to an immortal person determined to imprison you until you die.She's never punished for killing a fae. Lucien and Tamlin tell her about magical creatures that could give her what she wants, and the next day she walks out and finds them...the elusive creatures...that are hard for fae to find?Lucien is about the only well developed character, and he's too sexualized sometimes for me to take me seriously. If you keep pointing out the abs, tanned skin, or whatever on the dude, you're turning them into a slab of meat. All of the males, and truthfully the females as well, in ACOTAR are ""perfect"" in the idea of what today's society thinks is beauty, sexy, and amazing at everything. This is sexist on every account. Your characters become nothing more than fantasies--which is why I say this is nothing more than porn/erotica.Sure, you can get some great messages out of this series, but is it worth all of the dung in the way? Specifically with the later books, there's too much sex at some points for it to even be OK. Please, go try to have sex that many times or for days on end and tell me how that is. if you can do that, I'm sorry, but you're either a whore or you're just kinda crazy, because that's too much.Why I ever read this book and like it, I truthfully don't know, but I'm done with this series. I'm done with this fandom, and I'm fed up with seeing people ""swoon"" or make comments or even draw/like at that nude art about LITERARY CHARACTERS. Guys, seriously? This is not a book for young girls, but when I went to the first (and last) Maas event, most of the audience there were between the ages of 14-20 (predominately 15-17 years of age) and SCREAMED when Maas was mentioning SEX SCENES. I'm not going to continue to support a series that is encouraging young teens and young women to have unrealistic ideas of men as well as sexual fantasies, especially the married women who I've seen act this same way. if I were your husband, I wouldn't be able to deal with that. I wouldn't want those books in my house.About the only good thing I have to say for ACOTAR was that there actually was a plot in this book, and it was good, if insanely slow to get rolling, and the amount of sex was fairly minimal.",TRUE,13-11-2018,"Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2018",1635575567
197,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 1)",‡ÆêBeauty and the Beast meets Faerie ‡Æê,Robin Snyder,3,"‡ÆêBeauty and the Beast meets Faerie ‡Æê ‚Äì I should ADORE this but overall it was just okay. There are things I totally loved about this story, but they are marred by the things that didn‚Äôt quite work out for me and so what I‚Äôm left with is feeling in the middle where I didn‚Äôt love it but I didn‚Äôt hate it either.I‚Äôm a huge fan of beauty and the beast retellings or most fairytales actually, but Belle is my absolute favorite heroine because she is smart, reads and doesn‚Äôt fall head over heels for the first pretty face that happens along. She and I could totally be BFFs. Then there is the Fae. Now I‚Äôm not a big expert on faerie stories or anything like that, but I find the Fae to be totally interesting creatures and usually like it when they are incorporated into stories. Instead if this being a magical mashup that made the story soar to new heights of awesome I found myself seeing some serious sour notes that disjointed the story and made it feel clunky.The stuff I totally LOVED ‚Äì‚úß - Tamlin and his Faerie world - There are some really interesting descriptions of the time spent at the his manor. The lake full of starlight, the manor, the art and his court cursed to all be in masks. Tamlin is completely likable right from the near beginning.‚úßLucien ‚Äì He is a spunky guy full of vim and vinegar that Fayre has a lot of fun verbally sparring with and getting into general trouble. He is also a great friend to Tamlin and I love the brotherly bound between them. While Lucien has an easy way with people he is working hard to help his friend find the right way to woo Fayre.‚úß The Love Story ‚Äì I enjoyed the time Tamlin and Feyre were getting to know each other and the tentative flirting the best. I really wish there was maybe just a little more time spent on it as it was the basis for the last 40% of the book.‚ÄúMy father once told me that I should let my sisters imagine a better life‚Äîa better world. And I told him that there was no such thing.‚Äù I ran my thumb over his mouth, marveling, and shook my head. ‚ÄúI never understood‚Äîbecause I couldn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt believe that it was even possible.‚Äù I swallowed, lowering my hand. ‚ÄúUntil now.‚Äù‚úß The ‚ÄòTasks‚Äô ‚Äì I like the idea behind completing some challenges to prove your worth and love. I liked even more that it was Feyre The Girl who had to do this instead of prince charming. It was a nice twist to a normal Fairytale.‚úß - The Curse ‚Äì while not particularly a fan of the fact the curse made Tamlin and his court all have to wear masks (since I really thought it would have been better if they all had to remain in animal form) I did like the final symmetry and cruelty of the curse. It was different and I totally respect that, it was a truly Fae curse in the level of cruelty behind it.‚úß Rhysand ‚Äì was my FAVORITE CHARACTER and I‚Äôll totally admit I‚Äôm still not sure what exactly I think of him. I will say this though, he is the most interesting character in the book whether he is playing on the side of good or evil‚Ä¶.well you will have to make your own decision on that. But I seriously hoping the next book is about him.As this is the start of a new series I will give it some leeway at getting started. There are some really fun parts to the story and even though it is a bit clunky at times I still got to a point when they are ‚ÄòUnder the Mountain‚Äô that I needed to get through the story to see how it all worked out and this is where the story mostly stayed on the like side of the line.The stuff that missed the mark:‚ú¶ - When writing about a well-established lore I think there are some things that perhaps the reader will ‚Äòaccept‚Äô or ‚Äònot accept‚Äô based on how important or ingrained it is OR the story the author puts with the lore change. Based on my various readings there are a few things about fantasy creatures that are ingrained into me. I KNOW that‚ûú Vampires ‚Äì Drink blood, Can‚Äôt be in the sun and die by a wooden stake through the heart‚ûú Werewolves ‚Äì Silver bullets, Shifting (of some kind), Full Moon‚ûú Fae ‚Äì Immortal Tricksters, CAN‚ÄôT LIE‚ûú Zombie ‚Äì Human dead, eat fleshI‚Äôm not going to say the Maas changed the Fae lore so much that she *Stephanie Meyer‚Äôd* it but she pretty much made a change to the Fae lore equivalent to making vampires sparkle in the sunlight. It isn‚Äôt quite a deal breaker for me, but I‚Äôm not a fan of that particular lore twist either.‚ú¶ It pains me to say this but Feyre and I didn‚Äôt get along until about 75% of the way through the book. She does so many stupid things that honestly I went from really liking her in the very beginning of the story to being completely annoyed with her.She began strong and independent with a family to support and I really liked that she wasn‚Äôt your typical virgin heroine. She hunted for her family and was the main supporter. Not conventionally educated she still came across as bright and strong.After ending up in Tamlin‚Äôs court and promising to stay the first thing Feyre tries to do is escape, when Tamlin assures her that he has seen to her family‚Äôs comfort she pouts and tries to find a way to escape again. She puts herself in dangerous situations without much thought in these attempts and really it was slightly tiresome.‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you warned to keep your wits about you?‚Äù Tamlin snapped. ‚ÄúThat your human senses would betray you?‚ÄùHe stepped beyond me and let out a snarl so vicious that whatever the thing was by the gates shimmered with light and darted out as fast as lightning streaking through the dark. ‚ÄúFool,‚Äù he said to me, turning. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre ever going to run away, at least do it in the daytime.‚ÄùI liked her a little more after she calmed down and decided to stay but the damage was done and she never made much headway with me again until toward the very end of the book when she became much more likable.‚ú¶The Curse ‚Äì( Yes I know that it is up in the like part as well, you get +5 points because you noticed) - The story made it seem like it was so horrible to be cursed to wear the masks but honestly I thought it made Tamlin hotter instead of diminished. Masks are sexy I don‚Äôt care who you are just think about it Zorro, Phantom of the Opera, a slew of superheroes AND‚Ä¶.The Dread Pirate RobertsTamlin had a beast form so I thought it would have worked possibly better if she had to fall in love with only his personality. Just an opinion.‚ú¶The ‚ÄòRite‚Äô ‚Äì There is a moment in the book where there is a spring festival. I‚Äôm not a prude I swear but it really bothered me how that played out. The whole scene made me feel a little strange and I really wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with my feelings about it. Maybe if I knew some other Fae stories and knew that was what ‚ÄòThe Rite‚Äô of spring was I wouldn‚Äôt have minded but I was not prepared. On a good note I was happy that it didn‚Äôt have any negative residual affects between Feyre and Tamlin.Overall Thoughts:Sometimes at the beginning of a new series you can‚Äôt see the big picture and that is why the first book of it might fall a little flat for you. I will say that when I read Throne of Glass it was just an okay book for me as well but then I loved both Crown of Midnight and Heir of Fire. I‚Äôm hoping that is also the case with this series.Based on how the book ended I have some really high hopes for the next book of this series. If you like fairytale retellings or Faerie stories then I say still give this one a go. If anyone can deliver a stronger second book to a series it is Maas so I‚Äôm not concerned and think she could be off to a solid start.Begs Sarah J. Maas to have the next book be about Rhysand and dare I hope for it..‚Ä¶.Nesta",TRUE,08-05-2015,"Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2015",1635575567

The chronic excessive explanation with surroundings in the environment and feelings, almost worded as if taken from poetry books to a point of where it doesn‚Äôt even make sense sometimes, just keeps taking away from enjoying the plot already. I just want to get to the point of what matters between characters, and though it‚Äôs normal to have it drawn out in most fictional relationships to keep the suspense, this series just did it too much for my liking.

I might lost some of my favorite critics over this because I know a lot of you weren‚Äôt a fan of this book. And I have some pretty intense feelings about some of the biggest criticisms lmao. I will talk about some flaws with the book still, as no book is perfect. But for the most part I really loved it. There will be rants. I have ALOT to say. Sooo here we go before I lose my nerve lmao.My main petty annoyance: the fact that tamlin uses his paws the same way a human uses hands even when he‚Äôs in beast form lol. There I said it. Now let‚Äôs move on to hopefully not my most controversial review ever. I feel like I‚Äôm supposed to hate MAAS and her writing. But I don‚Äôt. I really love what she did here.Characters:Feyre:I really don‚Äôt get the hate. Maybe she gets worse later. Maybe. But people hate her in this book too and I don‚Äôt get why. She was meh to me. I admired her in some ways and hated her in others. I loved her heart, and how often she let it guide her even if it resulted in her ignoring everything anyone told her. Which yes- did annoy me sometimes. But it wasn‚Äôt that bad.now we get to the fun part.Tamlin and rhyes (similar thoughts on both)-Oh my god. The reasons you guys hate this dude are absurd in this book. Every single thing I was told to look out for and that would start me into hating him was ridiculous. I genuinely believe you guys just don‚Äôt ship him and feyre so that makes him immediately sooo horrible. Same for the rhyes haters.You guys have to stop inserting in a fantasy setting and acting like any of the decisions made are simple. Both of them are great in their own way- and both had feyres interest in mind in my opinion. The questionable things they do, because yes there are some...Are either for show to SAVE feyre and everyone else. It‚Äôs all so obviously calculated and here you guys are trying to critique it like they‚Äôre events that happened over tea in a totally normal world with nothing intense or life threatening going on around them. Just why.I‚Äôm team Rhys just because I like him a little more- and I love the way he thinks and speaks. But I also love tamlin and am still rooting for him to be happy.I think they‚Äôre both fleshed out brilliantly and have many layers that I can‚Äôt wait to uncover. They both have scars and they BOTH have really unfortunate situations that are eating away at them that make them who they are. I‚Äôm just saying... think about the alternative that could happen if they didn‚Äôt make some of their questionable choices.They wouldn‚Äôt have done half the stuff they did for this one human... if they didn‚Äôt truly care.Villain-Well she‚Äôs like not very nice lol so of course I don‚Äôt like her and I‚Äôm not rooting for her but...idk I put her here because I did kind of have a problem with how stupid she seemed to be for someone who was supposed to be cunning. She let certain people get away with way too much, and didn‚Äôt seem to notice or care. It was strange because then she would just randomly turn into a brutal witch out of nowhere but then let certain things happen other times. I‚Äôm sure some of it was her calculating but... still. It seemed a little weak.She‚Äôs bitter, brutal and interesting. The ring, will probably haunt my nightmares. She just wasn‚Äôt as developed.Lucien-I don‚Äôt want him with feyre but I just wanted to say... despite me liking tam and rhyes... Lucien will forever be my babe. I love him the most. He‚Äôs so complex and he‚Äôs been through so much.He‚Äôs witty, intelligent, and overall just cares about people even when he pretends he doesn‚Äôt. I want nothing but greatness for him lol. His story is heart breaking as well.The rest- this story is filled with intriguing, misunderstood, and terrifying creatures. No complaints there.Her family- feyres family is on my poop list. But I don‚Äôt hate nesta even now as some of you seem to. Maybe I‚Äôm a mean bitter person... Idk.The plot-Like every plot it has both weak and strong points. I loved seeing the world unfold, and getting to see a good chunk of it before the action started.I did think the twist with the masks and how convenient all of the events were was well... convenient....while it did lead to the most exciting parts, I felt like the point of it was kinda glossed over and the explanation for why things were how they are wasn‚Äôt too important to the story.But it came over decently- and the ending wasn‚Äôt terrible. So I‚Äôm happy.I still got the magical yet unsettling experience I wanted. And I can‚Äôt wait to see more of this world.I really feel like it‚Äôs just the cool thing to hate maas and these books now. But I don‚Äôt see them as problematic as a lot of people seem to.

200,A Little Life,A tragic and memorable tale,borderzkai,4,"You know when someone talks to you about a ‚Äúsad book,‚Äù and you immediately think, ‚Äúwell, someone precious is going to die at the end?‚Äù A Little Life has been called tragic, depressing, a masterpiece that you cannot get through without a wad of tissues nearby, and so naturally, I assumed someone would die at the end. I went into this book prepared to not get too attached to the characters, but it‚Äôs inevitable to not connect with people who are the subjects of an 800-page book with minimal spacing and tiny font. I‚Äôd like to think I went into this book prepared, but my preparation got me nowhere.This novel does not lead up to a sad ending. Let me explain. Calling this novel ‚Äúsad‚Äù is a massive understatement. It is 800 pages of tragedy after tragedy, because the ‚Äúsad‚Äù doesn‚Äôt follow the pattern we are used to. It‚Äôs not happy and pleasant until the end where something sad happens- no, this book is a depressing hunk of paper with very little happiness in it. A Little Life is a long, winding tunnel spotted with skylights. You walk forward in the darkness with a couple of friends, and you are struck with sadness after sadness. Your friends get lost in the tunnel, you fall and break your arm, and then the tunnel gives you a foot of light where you can look around and take a breather before plunging yourself into the darkness. You don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs at the end, because the tunnel gives you no hints. You don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll exit into the open. You don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll hit a dead-end, but you keep on walking because by this point, your masochism has kicked in and you‚Äôre addicted to the torture.We follow the stories of four characters, all college-friends who have moved from Boston to New York City in order to fulfill their dreams. Malcolm is an aspiring architect- timid and shy, whose overbearing parents are his pride and shame. JB is a painter- arrogant, optimistic and full of life, JB is the only one among his friends who is certain he will make it in life. Willem is an actor, calm and steady who has no family but his three best friends. But while the three have their own lives, their bond is strengthened by the presence of one Jude St. Francis. Jude is enigmatic. Despite having been friends for years, nobody knows anything about him; not his ethnicity or his sexuality. They don‚Äôt know anything about his childhood or his years before attending university. Jude has an injury; an accident severely limited the use of his legs, but nobody even knows how this came to be. But Jude is quiet, and he is kind and generous and dependent. And so the three friends lend their shoulders silently for him to lean on. This book is not set in one time period: years and decades pass, and each character matures, develops and experiences success and the perils of life, sometimes together, other times apart. As the narrative progresses, one thing becomes crystal clear: Jude has gone through an unspeakable childhood trauma. He is fragile and broken, battling so hard with inner demons that never seem to leave him.If you‚Äôre looking for a fast-paced, action-packed, plot-centered novel, put this book down and walk far, far away. A Little Life reads more like an in-depth character study than anything else. Despite there being a large, diverse, well-fleshed out cast of characters- make no mistake: this novel is about Jude. This novel is about Jude‚Äôs life, his depression, his experiences, his feelings of pain and insurmountable shame. It is a story about Jude‚Äôs relationships and his impact on the people around him. It is a story about love and loss, of betrayal and friendship, of perseverance and giving in. And because it follows the story of such a broken, intense young man, it is a difficult read.It is a difficult read in more ways than one. Firstly, it is 800 pages long with very little action, with large chunks of paragraphs detailing the little moments in life, detailing theorems and laws and art and literature. Large chunks that talk about family, sex, career and the meaning of love- things that may not even need to be in the book. These large chunks familiarize you with our characters‚Äô backgrounds, their introspections and streams of consciousness, their experiences with each other and outside of their immediate relationships. The characters in this novel feel real; more than once, I felt like I could reach out and touch them. They feel like friends, comrades you‚Äôve known for a long, long time. Their happiness genuinely excites you, and their sadness genuinely devastates you. You also become so invested in their relationships with each other, almost as if you‚Äôre a mediator.Apart from the thematic material, what makes this novel so hard to digest is the characters. I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that they feel like friends- watching them suffer through unimaginable things hurt me. I have never felt this way before. Halfway through the book, I had already cried at least twice, excluding the point where I sobbed for ten pages straight. And then again after. Yanagihara‚Äôs empathetic portrayal of human nature, of human decency and monstrosity is so spot-on. I don‚Äôt know what else I can say.Secondly, it is brutal in its honest, unflinching portrayal of mental illness. There were several moments in this novel where I had to set the book aside and steady my breathing. It is uncomfortable. It depicts self-harm and depression graphically but not gratuitously, with sensitivity without doing it for ‚Äúthe shock factor.‚Äù Finally, the constant jumps in time frame makes this book far from a casual read. You need to keep up. Each ‚Äòsection‚Äô takes place a few years after the previous one, but sometimes Yanagihara alternates time within paragraphs as well. One time you‚Äôre seeing the friends‚Äô lives when they are 35, and you jump back in the middle of a paragraph to when they are 28. It can be quite jarring if you‚Äôre not paying attention.But having said that, Yanagihara‚Äôs writing is easy to keep up with. Daunting as it may be with its intelligent discussion of many themes (some of which I mentioned above) and the sheer scale of the book, her writing is welcoming. Complex, full of emotion and genuine feeling, full of ‚Äòquotable‚Äô things without it ever being overbearing or ‚Äòtoo much.‚Äô Authors writing in the literary fiction genre so often give off the impression that they need to prove something, but Yanagihara writes with effortless grace and poise. She‚Äôs not trying to prove anything; this is her in 800 pages- take it or leave it.But despite all my praises, this is not a perfect book. My main complaint is the length. Bear with me. I have no problems with lengthy books, as long as the length is justified. Many will probably disagree with me, but I felt that the novel could have been cut short by at least 50 or 100 pages. For example, towards the beginning, we get such an in-depth look into JB and Malcolm‚Äôs characters, much of which doesn‚Äôt come back after the first section. Perhaps their backgrounds could have been weaved more seamlessly into the narrative as the book went along. A lot of the objective discussions about science and mathematics were beautifully written, sure, but didn‚Äôt feel like they needed to be there. But I‚Äôve got to give Yanagihara this: despite the length, and despite the discussions on objective topics, I was hanging on to her every word. I didn‚Äôt skim a single page- I was just that invested.So, here we are. You and me at the mouth of the tunnel. I made it out, and you‚Äôre asking me if you should take the chance. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult. It‚Äôs long. It‚Äôs even terrifying at times, but-‚Äù and I prod you into the darkness, ‚Äúit‚Äôs also exhilarating and beautiful and one hell of an experience.‚Äù",TRUE,03-09-2016,"Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2016",804172706
201,A Little Life,‚ÄúLost to the World‚Äù,Eclectic Reader,5,"I‚Äôll be blunt upfront. A LITTLE LIFE (2015) by Hanya Yanagihara is the most soul-wrenching novel I have perhaps ever read. In the novel Yanagihara follows in minute detail the lives of four men who become friends, ‚Äúa clique,‚Äù in college and continue to be close into their late fifties. JB Marion begins his work life as a ‚Äúreceptionist at a small but influential magazine based in SoHo that covered the downtown art scene,‚Äù with ambitions to become an artist. Fatherless since he was three, JB is of Haitian descent, tends toward being overweight, and is gay. Willem Ragnarsson, handsome and ‚Äúliked by everyone‚Äù starts out as a waiter, but has his eye set on becoming a professional actor on stage and screen. In ways, Malcolm Irvine is the outlier of the group, still living at home with his parents who are a couple of mixed-race. He is wealthy and determined to become an architect. Malcolm appears to be oblivious of his appeal to others, even na√Øve, somewhat confused about his sexuality, and unmindful of his financial situation although generous to his friends and others when they are in need. At the core of the four friends is Jude St. Francis who holds the group together‚Äînot so much by what he does even though he is considerably bright, loyal, and hard-working, as well as determined to become a prosecutor, but because his friends care about him and Jude has needs. Parentless and with a mysterious past all of which he never speaks about and never having ‚Äúa girlfriend or a boyfriend,‚Äù Jude has trouble with his legs and is frequently in pain. Although he never complains nor asks for help, his friends are very aware of his situation and go out of their way to assist Jude in as tactful of a manner as possible.Mainly set in New York City, as A LITTLE LIFE unfolds, Yanagihara brings into the fold other characters of importance including a doctor, Andy Contractor, and a former law professor, Harold Stein and his wife Judy, all of whom play important roles in in the novel, as well as a host of minor characters. It is, however, the four friends who remain central to the story, especially Jude and Willem, roommates in college and who remain the closest of the friends. The bulk of Yanagihara‚Äôs novel is told in chronicle order, but as the novel progresses, there are more flashbacks and memories, some of which get repeated with added detail as they surface, most of them revolving around Jude who becomes more and more the novel‚Äôs central character.When thinking about tragic characters in prose fiction, no one comes my mind as being more tragic than Jude Fawley from Thomas Hardy‚Äôs JUDE THE OBSCURE (1894/1895) which may be the motivation for the author‚Äôs name for her main character‚ÄîJude, ‚Äúthe patron saint of lost causes.‚Äù Although readers soon come to the realization Jude is a physically and emotionally scarred individual, Yanagihara‚Äôs revelations about the details of Jude‚Äôs history are painfully slow in coming‚Äîmirroring the complexity and rawness of those very memories which haunt and torment Jude. They are memories which have shaped, or rather distorted, his life. In one flashback the author reveals twenty-five years in the past, Ana, Jude's now deceased ‚Äúfirst and only social worker‚Äù warning Jude during a hospital stay, ‚Äú‚Ä¶you have to talk about these things while they‚Äôre fresh. Or you‚Äôll never talk about them‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs going to fester inside you, and you‚Äôre always going to think you‚Äôre to blame. You‚Äôll be wrong, of course, but you‚Äôll always think it.‚ÄùThere are relatively few highs in Jude‚Äôs life and when they occur, the reader is bound to find them tearful moments of joy. The increasingly close friendship between Jude and Willem with both of them at the zenith of their careers is complex‚Äîfilled paradoxically with the bounty which human relationships can contain along with enormous peril. Unfortunately, most of Jude‚Äôs life is a series of unrelenting, dreadful, terrifying, shattering lows and betrayals accompanied by self-destructive impulses which become worse and worse, adding to a man‚Äôs already burdensome childhood, youth, and life-long post-traumatic stress. Jude‚Äôs is a portrait of suffering beyond comprehension and the brutal perpetrators of his torments throughout his life are the epitome of unfathomable, monstrous human behavior.Thus, A LITTLE LIFE does not make for easy reading. It is emotionally jolting and at the same time riveting. So vivid are Yanagihara‚Äôs expose of the quartet of characters, the reader becomes one with them, making it a quintet. The author‚Äôs characters are real to life, the dialogue is vivid and genuine, and the quality of the writing as well as the tone of the novel is unswerving. Although Yanagihara‚Äôs central characters meet with sometimes staggering personal and professional successes, there are also failures and tragedies, both past and present, and always a dire cloud which encircles them all, especially Jude. Due to her immense and encompassing narrative skills, readers will eventually brace themselves so that whenever a horrifying revelation is made about Jude‚Äôs secret past or his present, there is likely worse to come.A narrative trick Yanagihara pulls a little over a quarter of the way into the novel and again at the half-way point, moving from an omniscient narrator to what clearly is a first person although not readily identifiable narrator, is bound to strike the reader as both curious and possibly even portentous. It is left up to the reader to recognize and interpret for themselves the meaning of the author‚Äôs temporary changes in point of view. She does the same switch near the book‚Äôs conclusion which eventually brings the work to its shocking climax and even more emotionally numbing, traumatic end.Clearly, A LITTLE LIFE is not for everyone. even though the novel is a modern masterpiece of writing and prose fiction and a work which will haunt the reader for a long time. The most resilient reader may very likely find there are times when they simply must close the book and exit the bleakness of the world Yanagihara creates before picking the book up again. Others may discover there are times when they simply want to throw the book across the room. Some readers may find the book impossible to finish because it is so emotionally draining. Regardless of the reader‚Äôs reaction to the novel, A LITTLE LIFE is an incredible accomplishment and a work which haunt the reader for a long time.[NOTES: (1) A LITTLE LIFE has recently been declared one of ‚ÄúThe 20 Best Novels of the Decade‚Äù by Emily Temple for The Literary Hub on December 23, 2019.

202,A Little Life,A little long,switterbug/Betsey Van Horn,4,"This is a novel that requires patience, commitment, and perseverance. Not just because of its length (720 pages), but, because it doesn't exactly grab you swiftly. It took me almost 300 pages to feel installed in the story, rather than just a visitor hovering outside the narrative. Yanagihara is long-winded, although not generally dull, yet she also, in my opinion, only fully realized one character, Jude St. Francis, the successful but troubled Ivy League-educated lawyer with a tragic, troubled past. The mostly interior story is ostensibly about these four friends who meet in their teens, and their ongoing friendship for over thirty years. But, really, it is a profile of Jude (with some shared traits of the Obscure one).Jude was ritually abused as an orphan, although the author is quite circumspect about the details, which take 2/3 of the novel to completely fill in (and even then, there's always more). However, even before I was enervated by the laboriously slow reveal, the reader ""gets it,""--this isn't exactly new stuff for our topical times, but it always dismays us to hear about disturbed, violent people who abuse children. By the time she filled in the shocking details, I was astonished, yes, but also a bit weary.There's also a lot of repetition of Jude's adult coping behaviors (in ways, almost as horrifying as the abuse)-- but necessary, I suppose, to really be intimate with his ongoing struggles, to demonstrate the limitless loneliness and pain one suffers when life is clouded by shame. But, I admit to some impatience, too. I was straining to believe that everyone was ALWAYS therapeutic with Jude. He was glum and intractable, refusing to talk about his past (with a few people, he revealed bits and pieces)--but, as I said, their ability to be so 110% willing and available for Jude was really too good to be true. Rarely, they lost patience-- carefully manipulated by the author to usually further the story along (and Jude).Jude's three friends, ones he has known since college--Willem, the successful actor, Malcolm, the successful architect, and JB, the successful artist (actually, all the characters in this book are so highly successful as to be almost untouchable, no pun intended), start out as developing characters, and then slip into either straw men and/or saints. Then there is Andy, the virtuous and always available surgeon, and Harold, the law professor with the patience of Job. All these men (with one seeming exception--JB, who makes a few mistakes) are so thoroughly, unerringly, and impossibly pledged to Jude that it eventually strikes a false note. All of these very busy people--world travelers--seem to have drop-everything time and an almost pious forbearance for Jude, the enigmatic one who refuses to reveal his past and his harrowing abuses. There were virtually no female characters--well, Harold's wife, Julia, and Malcolm's, wife, but they were nothing but generic passers-by, even if (like Julia) they played an important role. They were all tools for the character of Jude.If I were to name a second, well-developed character, it would be the setting. No matter how many books are set in New York City, there are as many ways and more to bring it alive. Yanagihara has a sharp eye for living spaces, architecture, color, and art, and in this way, she gave New York its singular charisma. I would also assert that having an architect and an artist as two of Jude's friends allowed her to buttress the book with her eye for these details, which I enjoyed greatly. JB's installations (of course, mostly about Jude or himself, and conveniently about the other friends for later absorption) added shade to the story, but, again, it seemed that everything was for Jude's character.This is a mostly interior novel, which is why I demand either faceted characters or compelling ideas. The author flirts with ideas through the art world but there's nothing inherently philosophical about the novel. Moreover, the author gave all the other characters, except for Jude, short shrift. Willem actually starts out engaging. His childhood was also tragic, but for different reasons. Yet, too soon, Willem turns into a big movie star and his character a cursory device for Jude. Willem is the most saintly of all the characters, an actor who is never self-absorbed, who isn't even aware of his fame when he walks into a room. He's portrayed as way too humble to be organic.Most of the men in this novel made me think of those Seurat paintings, where the people whose faces we never see too well are diminished or faded into the background. Is that what the author intended? I don't think so, because in her debut book, The People in the Trees , she had several well-realized characters. Moreover, in 700+ pages, she includes Jude's friends frequently, but the more they are present, the more absence I felt of their true natures. She also covered the topic of child abuse in both novels, but, in TREES, it's for the reader to ascertain, over the course of the suspenseful story, whether the narrator is reliable or not, and if the child abuse really did take place. In A LITTLE LIFE, we know it took place, and we follow the abused child mostly as an adult.Just a side note: Yanagihara tends to pair abuse with a life of privilege. In The People in the Trees , the alleged abuser is a scholar/scientist. In this second book, the victim of abuse grows to be in the elite 1%. I would like to see her take it down a notch--show how many abused children are stuck in the system or live in the real world as a worker bee, not touched by highbrow living, and too impaired to put together a successful life. Jude, however, is an accomplished pianist with a beautiful voice, is well-read, a superior cook, and is what I would identify as that rare contemporary Renaissance man--but he works as a corporate lawyer 80-100 hours/week, where his troubles seem to melt away on the job.Regardless of the flaws, I stuck with the novel; Jude was so captivating, even in his reticence, that I wanted to see it through. I think Yanagihara could have shaved off a few hundred pages without hurting the narrative, especially as she didn't seem intent on filling out the characters beyond a certain point.At the beginning, there was evidence that there would be nuance regarding race and sexual orientation. A few comments were made at the start, coyly referring to the fact that only Willem is white. Jude was ""undetermined,"" a mix of backgrounds, and Malcolm and JB were black. So why a white man on the cover of the book? Is that supposed to be Willem? That seems disingenuous to me, as the main character, Jude, is not Caucasion. That was just one of the several manipulations that seemed inorganic.Also, there seemed to be little or no controversy about gay issues. Some of the characters were gay or bi-, but they didn't seem to go through any hardships, past or present, with their sexual orientation. It was so smooth that it was glossed over. Parents--proud and accepting, peers--proud and accepting, colleagues--proud and accepting. Nothing in these men's lives stirred any controversy or hardship (unless it has to do with their relationship with Jude)--just success. Even JB's problems were disposed of quickly. But, I suppose if you are in the 1%, being black and gay buys you a ticket from discrimination? These men had a paved avenue, so much more than my black and/or gay friends ever did. However, her prose was always strong, solid, subtle:""...he imagined Jude as a magician whose sole trick was concealment, but every year, he got better and better at it, so that now he only had to bring one wing of the silken cape he wore before his eyes and he would become instantly invisible, even to those who knew him best.""3.5 stars",TRUE,09-06-2015,"Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2015",804172706

Jude St. Francis is a brilliant lawyer, a talented pianist, a generous friend, but deeply troubled and scared. There are secrets from his past that he holds so close, keeping them even from his friends, that slowly unfurl in the most heartbreaking and gut wrenching way.How someone who is so loved, reassured, and supported by the people that surround them can still be convinced that they are unworthy of such love and normalcy is a true testament to how debilitating and damn near irreversible some traumas can be. I cried for Jude, I was livid for Jude, I was in awe and proud of Jude! But I was also frustrated with Jude. I wanted to dive into the pages and try to convince him myself how unimaginably brave and deserving he was of all the good fortune he had found after his dark years. To tell him it‚Äôs not his fault.

204,A Little Life,"4.75-Stars: Excruciating and Diabolical, but Masterfully Written",Booksalottle,5,"I finished Hanya Yanagihara's emotionally draining, 'A Little Life', over three months ago and in the time since, I felt I needed to recover from her roller coaster of a novel. Imagine though a roller coaster that is on fire, but has classical music playing on its back row as it dips and ascends into screaming terror and melancholic euphoria.Upon completing this novel, I was fatigued, drained, and spent of my emotions because I have never equally hated and admired a book so much in my literary life. On two occasions while reading, I took a shot of tequila to get through particular sections. Sections where when the tequila did not help, I put the book down because the book's content read like being hit by a Mack truck at full speed. Nothing in this novel is subtle, as a matter of fact, I equate reading it to a jackhammer puncturing hard-baked cement and you the reader is the cement. The storytelling is piercing, with plangent themes that gutted my insides, and it is so visceral that it ostensibly paints Yanagihara to be a sadistic fiend for unleashing a literary work such as this. She's of course not, she's simply a good writer who knows how to bring a heartbreaking story to life.Yes, 'A Little Life' is an agonizing read, but one that was masterfully written, offering all manner of literary rewards. Employing use of a dense, particularized writing style, Yanagihara's prose is architectural, cerebral, and drawn out at a pace that is like molasses rolling up a sand dusted hill. From page one, I found the four protagonists to be engaging, but forebodingly so, where I immediately knew that there will be a lot to unpack in the subsequent pages ahead. Though the novel's setting is contemporary, Yanagihara tells it in an odd but effective flashback mixed with present day style where the context of time is always abstract. Specific dates or years are never used, instead we get descriptors such as ""nine years ago,"" ""on his fifth birthday,"" ""four years after..."" This approach bothered me initially, because it made some of the flashback scenes less textural. But Yanagihara is such a good writer, she made the technique work, as it became tolerable as I read on. Again, nothing in this novel is subtle or plain, but despite the elaborately detailed descriptions, which I admired, the novel is readable. Although, I think some readers may find it to be plodding.For me, I think one of Yanagihara's strength as a writer is her ability to flesh out characters as if they were filigree, branching them out far and wide, but characters that have a centered, yet deeply flawed souls. As well written as each of the characterizations are here, I admit that I dislike every one of them. The four protagonists - Jude, Willem, Jean-Baptist, and Malcolm, plus two major secondary ones, Andy, and Harold - all made my emotions seesaw from vexation to sympathy, but mostly vexation. Jude, the center of the novel's story, is especially maddening. He is a self imposed martyr, at times grating, and is in constant need of attention, attention that is wanted or not. Yet, I couldn't help but be heartbroken for him due to his disquieting childhood and unenviable lot in life.Another source of frustration was that 'A Little Life' has in my opinion, an uncomfortable air of incestuous camaraderie between the six protagonists, a bothersome co-dependency that drove me up the wall. Everyone in Jude's life - Willem, Jean-Baptist, Malcolm, Andy, and Harold, individually and collectively coddle him to such an extant that it borders on criminal. I was bothered that each of these characters allowed their hubris and selfishness to take precedence over the necessary tough love that Jude needed. The enabling and coddling became reductive, and peeved me so badly that I yelled out at my book several times. Still, despite my irritation at the imbecilic actions of the characters, I couldn't help but regress into pity and gut-wrenching grief for each of their lives. Eventually, my dislike of the characters became irrelevant, as I don't think characters have to be likable in order to be effective. At any given time, I was mad at each of them, but in their frustrating behavior, they made me think long and hard about human frailty.Despite my frustrations, and even at 720 densely packed pages, 'A Little Life' is a worthy read. Make no mistake, as it did me, this is a novel that will peel your insides and likely wreck you. There were moments where I could only read certain chapters in short spurts, with breaks between paragraphs because the content is so unsettling. Nevertheless, I read it all, because even though this is a fictional story, I can't help but think that it is the life that some unfortunate souls have lived, and or are living right now.I highly recommend 'A Little Life', but again be warned, the content is visceral, EXCRUCIATING, and unrelenting. The depravity and evil that Yanagihara has showcased in these pages is unreal, and is unlike any I've ever read. As you progress though the novel, prepare yourself before reading pages 323-340, 392-403, 417-423. The entire book is not easy to get through, but these pages are especially ungodly. I don't care who you are or how strong you are, I think this book is one that will wreck most.

260,The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom Book),A Trip Into Mysticism,J. M. Alexander,4,"The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz & The Fifth Agreement by Don Miguel Ruiz and Don Jose Ruiz I decided to ‚Äúreview‚Äù or ‚Äúsummarize‚Äù these books together because the Fifth Agreement is very much a continuation of the first book, and in fact reiterates much of the earlier text. Both are based on the philosophy of the Toltec, ancient people of southern Mexico who were known as women and men of knowledge. Before delving into the books, I should acknowledge that I found then somewhat difficult. Although I have read a great many of what I would call ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù books and wrings in the recent years, these readings, although similar, were a bit more difficult to fully digest. The author at times anticipates such problems on the part of the reader, and is indeed accurate in that regard. The Toltecs were not a race or tribe, or nation, but scientists and artists formed to explore and conserve the spiritual knowledge and practices of the ‚Äúancient ones‚Äù. They came together as masters (naguals) and students at Teotihuacan, the ancient city of pyramids outside Mexico City and known as the place where ‚ÄúMan Becomes God‚Äù. The Toltec recognize that some 3000 years ago a human studying to be a medicine man woke to the realization that everything is made of light and that all that exists is one living being, and that light is the messenger of life because it is alive and contains all information. He called the stars the tonal and the light between the stars the nagual, and knew what created the harmony between the two is life or intent. He saw himself in everything- in every human, every animal, every tree, in the water, the clouds and the earth. As I read the book, this seeing, this realization, is the truth, is pure love and pure light. It is this truth that we much search for. But why must we search if such truth is everywhere? We must search because we have lost the truth. When we are born devoid of language, we are the truth‚Äìour presence is a miracle. We feel and see what is, without interpretation or judgment. But, as we grow, we are what the author calls ‚Äúdomesticated‚Äù, just as animals are. The truth that we feel is replaced by symbols-words- that are mere illusions, that are opinions grafted onto objects and feelings. We apply our attention‚Äì the ability to discriminate and focus only on what we want to perceive- on these symbols. As children we believe what adults say, especially our parents, and our world becomes a dream, a reality built on symbols from others, not the silent feelings and observations that we experienced as infants. And this learned reality-our dream- tells us how to behave in society; what to believe and not believe; what is acceptable and not acceptable; what is good and bad; right and wrong; beautiful and ugly. We are imperfect because we do not measure up to an image of perfection that has been imposed on us by others. And we accept such law and structure by a system of reward for doing what is ‚Äúright‚Äù and punishment for doing what is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. This acceptance reflects a multitude of agreements we have made with our world. We are judged and punished and then punish ourselves for bad behavior. We become victims who carry guilt for such failures, and are punished again and again whenever we are reminded, or remind ourselves of such failures. We live in a dream ruled by fear and filled with emotions of anger, jealousy, envy and hate. We must be right and prove others wrong. Our mind and our world become a fog‚Äìa mitote- a dream where a thousand people talk at once and no one understands. The author feels that, as a result, we are living in a dream of hell. We then search for the truth, for a way out of this hell. And yet, the truth is already within us, we don‚Äôt have to search, we just have to uncover what is part of us already, as it was when we were born. To escape our dream of hell, we must break the old agreements that are fear based and reclaim our personal power. We must create a new dream, our own dream- our personal dream of heaven. The author suggests four basic agreements that you must make with yourself to reclaim your own power and find a heaven on earth, a life of joy and fulfillment. The First Agreement- Be Impeccable With Your Word. The author feels that this first agreement is the most important and powerful. I noticed a few things about the wording. First, he uses the singular ‚Äúword‚Äù, rather than ‚Äúwords‚Äù. I think perhaps this is in deference to the use of such term in the bible where John, speaking of creation, says ‚ÄúIn the beginning was the word, and the word was God, and the word is God.‚Äù Through words you express your creative power. But he obviously means the plural, that your use of language must be impeccable. The use of ‚Äúimpeccable‚Äù is also interesting. Our common definition of ‚Äúimpeccable‚Äù is faultless or flawless. But it also means incapable of sin or without sin. It is this meaning that the author employs. He feels that a sin is anything that goes against yourself, and being impeccable is not gong against yourself, taking responsibility for your actions, but not judging or blaming. He says that if one loves him or her self, then he or she will express that love in interaction with others, and will thus be impeccable with the word, because such word, such action, will produce a like reaction. He contrasts words coming from love with those coming from what he calls black magic. He feels that gossip is the worst form of black magic, for it is judgmental language about others, even those we do not know. It is emotional poison that we teach to our children and friends and loved ones through our use of such criticism. The word is too often used to blame, to criticize, to find guilt and destroy. He gives the simple example of a child being told by her mother to shut up her singing because her voice was ‚Äúugly‚Äù. The child obviously agreed with her mother, and thus made an agreement with herself not to sing any more. These are the type of agreements that we make in life that are harmful and destructive, that lead us into our dream of hell. Instead, when you are impeccable with your words, they are no longer fertile ground for gossip and criticism, but for love. And as you use such words, first by expressing love for yourself, you break all the many agreements that make you suffer, and begin to build your own dream of heaven on earth. I don‚Äôt read ‚Äúimpeccable‚Äù to mean absolutely honest, for there are times when being absolutely honest could be counter to your words coming from love. The Second Agreement- Don‚Äôt Take Anything Personally. This is much easier said than done and I also think that the author assumes that one is practicing impeccability in their word before adopting this. He basically feels that people take things personally because we assume that things said are truly about us and that we are prone to believe them. In fact, he feels that people do not do or say things because of us, but because of themselves. Also, whatever they do or say is a product of their own belief system, of their own personal dream. Thus, what they may think about me is not about me but is about them. Instead of accepting this, we resort to the need to be right, and show the other wrong, so we magnify the power of their words or deeds. If instead we always act from a sense of love‚Äìthe impeccability of our word- then if someone is mad at me, then I know that he or she is mad at him or herself and I am just the excuse for their anger. When you stop taking things personally you can keep your heart open and not be harmed. You will not need to trust in what others do or say, but only trust yourself to make responsible choices. And you must remember that neither praise nor criticism is to be taken personally because it is not about you, but the speaker. As I said at the outset of my comments on this Agreement, I think, in discussing this Agreement, that the author assumes that he is impeccable with his word. If not, then how could he say that when someone gets mad at you they are mad at themselves? This may still be true even if you were not using your word impeccably, but it would be harder to accept, especially since, in his discussion of impeccability, the author says that one must take responsibility for his actions. Wouldn‚Äôt this mean that when we are less than impeccable that we must accept some consequence, but not punish our self endlessly? Couldn‚Äôt someone‚Äôs anger be about us if our word was less than impeccable, but instead filled with the black magic mentioned by the author? I raise these questions in my mind because at times, as I read through this, it sounds as if one can ‚Äúget a pass‚Äù for less than sterling behavior because he need not take others reactions personally. I don‚Äôt think this is the author‚Äôs message, but it could be read into some of the philosophy. The Third Agreement- Don‚Äôt Make Assumptions The author starts off his discussion with this statement: ‚ÄúAll the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personally.‚ÄùAlthough I would question the use of the word ‚Äúall‚Äù (I have a hard time with such broad statements like ‚Äúall‚Äù or ‚Äúnone‚Äù or‚Äúalways‚Äù or ‚Äúnever‚Äù), I basically agree with his statement, especially as it concerns emotional reaction to others. (True sadness from the passing of a child or similar ‚Äúobjective‚Äù tragedy is hard to relate to assumptions or taking things personally) I have found that people often assume my meaning, and sometimes take offense at something that was never intended to harm. They probably misunderstood, but, as the author notes, were afraid to ask for clarification and therefore filled in any uncertainty with an assumption. I don‚Äôt know exactly why we are afraid to ask for clarification, maybe it roots back to those days when we were reluctant to ask questions in school. Maybe it a fear of being wrong, even if it is a subjective response to another. I don‚Äôt know why we do such things, but know that we do, and that it causes great and unnecessary pain. I think these two agreements about taking things personally and making assumptions are really part of a self centeredness that ‚Äúit is all about me‚Äù. We often tell people, ‚Äòit‚Äôs not always about you‚Äù , but such words are almost in jest. In fact it is really important to realize that it isn‚Äôt always about you, especially when the assumptions made generally do assume so and lead to taking things personally. Not making assumptions would seem to be one of the easier agreements to live up to, as it only involves a little bit of inquiry. But, like any change, it requires practice. The author just suggests that you ‚ÄúMake sure the communication is clear. If you don‚Äôt understand, ask. Have the courage to ask questions until you are clear as you can be, and even then do not assume that you know all there is to know about a given situation.‚ÄùGood advice. The Fourth Agreement is About the Action of the First Three- Always do Your Best. The author stresses always doing your best, but knowing that your best will vary from one moment to the next depending on how you feel, etc. But, whatever your state, you must always do your best‚Äìneither less nor more. Trying to do more than your best will cause you to spend unneeded energy and, in the end, your best will not be good enough. You must be motivated to do your best not by some expected reward, but by the love of what you are doing. Doing your best will help with the other three agreements and it will also make you feel better even if you suffer failures in the other three. If you keep trying to do your best you will become a master of transformation-practice will make you the master. Always doing your best requires a great deal of effort. If you break an agreement, then you must be willing to begin again the next day and try your best to keep such agreement. In reading the author‚Äôs comments on this fourth agreement I am unsure whether he is relating ‚Äúdoing your best‚Äù to life in general or to the application of the other three agreements. I see his book as being primarily focused on reaching an internal contentment and happiness, not on navigating one‚Äôs way through the world at large. Admittedly, such inner contentment may well supply the path to successfully living in this rather complex world. I just find a bit of a contrast between the focus of this work and something like ‚ÄúFalling Upward‚Äù by Richard Rohr where he acknowledges the need to survive in the competitive world as a means of gaining some level of confidence before, in the second half of life, we are able to discard much of the baggage of the first half and seek out a more personal and spiritual contentment. Of course, this may be my misreading of both books, but, that‚Äôs what an opinion is all about. I also see a basic similarity between the two, and among other spiritual pieces that I have read. All see Western culture as imposing and espousing a very competitive, win/loose guilt ridden mentality. Such mentality may or may not be necessary for the struggles that we face, but, all my readings seem to agree that at some point our thoughts need to focus on attaining a more peaceful and inclusive level of spiritual contentment. This is the truth that the Four Agreements challenge you to seek. The Fifth Agreement - Be Skeptical but Learn to Listen As the author has pointed out, we learn from symbols, and these symbols do not represent the truth, which is present in everything. Symbols are people‚Äôs interpretations of objects and feelings and are not the truth, but are often lies. Thus, it is important to be skeptical, but he adds that you must then listen. When you listen carefully to others you can then understand the symbols that they are using and understand their story‚Äìtheir dream. Your communication improves and you can then see if what another is saying has relevance to you. You do not have to believe their story, for it is only symbols. Similarly, you do not have to believe your own story, for it is just made from your symbols. Neither story is the truth, the truth simply is, whether you believe in it or not. It doesn‚Äôt need you to believe, for it simply is. When you listen you don‚Äôt have to form or express opinions, you merely need to listen. By merely listening you show respect for the other person‚Äôs dream, for the reality he or she has created. The author sees all persons essentially as artists who create their worlds, and they must be respected as such. When we listen and share our stories, we try to understand them and make them part or our stories if we so desire‚Äìor not. If you gain control over your symbols then what is left is the real you, and the real you, not your symbols, makes your choices. In trying to summarize what the author is saying I find myself struggling at times to get to the crux of his message. I think that perhaps by expanding his work to this Fifth Agreement he intends to open the door to spread the wisdom of the Four Agreements to others. The first Four Agreements taught us that out symbols are not the truth, and that many of these symbols‚Äìour entire symbology as he calls it- are lies that lead us to blame and shame and guilt, to a living hell. The Four Agreements help us escape this personal hell, but perhaps there is more that we need to do. The author expands his discussion to outline the different stages that we go through as we try to reach our heaven on earth. He calls these steps ‚Äúattentions‚Äù. The first Attention is the dream we create when we first use our attention to absorb the various symbols that we learn, and we then believe such symbols represent knowledge and our reality. He calls this first attention the ordinary dream of humans or the dream of the victims. It is a dream of victims because we are the victims of the false symbols which form our reality. And our reality is not about us, it is a mirror reflecting what others expect of us and for us. You must be freed of such reality and discover your true self. Then we reach a stage where we realize that our dream is a lie and we use the attention a second time to try to change our dream and create a new one. This is the Second Dream of Attention or the Dream of the Warriors because we now declare war against all the lies in our knowledge. It is a war against that part of our mind that makes all the choices that guide us into our personal hell. It‚Äôs a war between out true self and our belief system‚Äìwhat the author calls the tyrant or the big judge. In this battle we fight to throw off the belief system that causes us to repeatedly punish ourselves for past ‚Äúwrongs‚Äù- the system that brings up past thoughts and punishes us over and over again. The author notes that ‚ÄúHumans are the only animals on earth who punish themselves a thousand times or more for the same mistake, and who punish everybody else a thousand times or more for the same mistake.‚ÄùHe instead postulates that true justice is to pay once for every mistake. As a warrior, one fights to find his true self. The author then notes that the dream of the second attention ends when something very important happens, something called the last judgment. This is the last time that we judge ourselves or anyone else. It‚Äôs the day we accept ourselves just the way we are and everyone else just the way they are. When the day of our last judgment comes, the war in our head is over and the dream of the third attention begins. We move from the dream of the warriors to the dream of the masters. This is a dream of truth and respect and joy. It is that point where we come back to our real state, our divine self, where we fell a communion of love with everything in existence. When we learn that the symbols are not the truth, then we are left to simply enjoy life, as we did before the symbols ruled us. We experience what he refers to as a resurrection, and it allows us to be wild and free like a child, except that we have freedom with wisdom instead of innocence. At this point we don‚Äôt need to judge ourselves or others, we don‚Äôt need to be right, nor prove others wrong, and we can express love with no shame or justification and walk in the world with our heart completely open. This is the goal‚Äì a life of joy. These books express a philosophy couched in rather mystical terms‚Äìin dreams and symbols, attention and awareness. But its message seems quite similar to other philosophies and much that is discussed in the current realm of what I will call a new spirituality. It suggests a path to find our spiritual connectedness to all of the world around us, a realization that we are each a part of everything, and that everything is a part of us. It reveals truth as not as description or a concept, but something that simply is. As the author points out, the physical nature of a chair is truth‚Äìits name is just a symbol, a symbol that can take a myriad of forms. I think he feels that a concept like goodness is also a truth that is intrinsically recognized and internal, and not a product of a value system that is imposed on us by others. As is love, and beauty. As do many others, he lauds the innocence of childhood, a time when the truth is real before we become ‚Äúdomesticated‚Äù. He doesn‚Äôt condemn such domestication, he just says that it is because all of us have been indoctrinated and pass that knowledge on. But, at least to me, he doesn‚Äôt recognize such conditioning as being a necessary part of that portion of our lives when we must learn to cope in our world. I think that this is the message that Richard Rohr sends in ‚ÄúFalling Upward‚Äù. I can easily be misreading both, but, so be it. The striking thing, as I read numerous books and other writings, and watch speeches, is the basic consistency in the message of oneness and the need to abandon, at least temporarily, much of what we have ‚Äúlearned‚Äù in order to open our minds, or perhaps clear our minds, so that we can receive the gift of interconnectedness. Whether this is termed as experiencing heaven, or nirvana, or ‚Äúoneness‚Äù is of no consequence. These are just names for a realization of our humble and insignificant position in a broader, more accepting, and more loving world than most of us witness day to day.",TRUE,04-07-2015,"Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2015",1878424319
261,The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom Book),"This is not ""new age"" self help book! This book is based on modern linguistic theory and philosophical precepts.",I'm Me Me,5,"I should start off by stating my background. I am an undergrad student of philosophy and linguistics, a branch of the humanities. I also deeply love this series of books because of its obviousness and simplicity. It has personally helped me triumph over many, many challenges. This is why I decided to write a review here.There is a huge tradition of skepticism in linguistics, especially about how language is used in various cultures to create belief systems. A belief system is basically a set of instructions inside your brain based on language. These instructions help you navigate the stressful world around you so you can survive. We are psychologically wired to think our belief systems are accurate and experience deep stress if we find them to be inaccurate.The trouble is, our belief systems are ALWAYS inaccurate. Yes, I used the word ""always"" for a reason.Without going deeply into the study of philosophy and linguistics, I will give you an overview here:Philosophy - When you study philosophy, you study belief systems about how the world works and explore important questions like ""is there a God?"" or ""What is consciousness."" You may not be surprised to find out that philosophy majors have not come up with answers to these questions because there is always a case where we are going to be wrong or have a counter argument. Much of the study of philosophy is the collection of vocabulary words to describe beliefs. They even have a mathematical component called propositional logic, where one takes sentences and reduces them to symbols and creates ""proofs"" but even prop-logic is under fire from academics for its complete inability to predict anything. In other words, it isn't the answer either.Linguistics - When you study words and language, you realize that all our beliefs are based on language and this language can never ""touch reality"" in that language is just an arbitrary description of reality, posing as real. I believe Miguel Ruiz must have taken a linguistics course as well--as his first agreement attests to the power of language. The four agreements pulls heavily from Saussure and Derrida. Both Saussure and Derrida (and many, many others) did work on how we form ideas in our heads based on language. The gist is this: we have something called a ""symbol"" in our brain which is composed of two parts: the word and the visual representation of the object (look up semiotics for further detail). These symbols are in our mind and work together to form meaning, then belief. The unfortunate thing is that they are entirely made up. It isn't real. Our ideas of it aren't real.If you really want a deeper understanding on how linguistics has saturated our belief systems I recommend reading some of their academic essays or get Rivkin and Ryan's literary theory books. They are excellent and will take you further down the rabbit hole. Most of the essays are dense but worth the effort!To simplify: scientists and academics in the millions have tried and tried and tried to find ""the true belief"" for thousands, maybe tens of thousands of years and we have not yet arrived at any truth. Because of domestication, we think other people have it, but they don't! ""Truth"" is defined as that which has the most predictive power. So far, mathematics, geometry, and physics has the most predictive power. Our belief systems simply do not.So any beliefs about yourself can be true and they can also be false. We can't know. So why not pick something positive? If no one knows anything, then how can you even know anything?But you don't need to study this yourself. All you have to do is think back to your past self, let's say ten years ago. Did that person have a belief system that you now consider to be faulty? How is that possible? What about your future self? Will that person believe you have a faulty belief system? Probably! How is this possible? How can you be SO WRONG? Is it because you ""haven't learned?"" I highly doubt it!But we have to be right! We ARE RIGHT! At least we think we might be . . . maybe?The need to be right is so ingrained within us that we create a huge drama when someone contradicts our beliefs. We end relationships over it! We storm out! We write angry twitter updates.HOW THIS BOOK HAS PERSONALLY HELPED ME:- No one person's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what I can do, even if this person is an authority figure- No one group's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what I can do- No one has a clear idea of who or what I am, not even me!- When people talk, they are telling stories. I don't have to argue. I don't have to fight. I simply have to listen. WOW!- I cannot comprehend another person's dream. I can't mind read. I can't assume. I know nothing of their inner workings.- Even scary, aggressive people are just telling stories.- I no longer have to feel ashamed about who I am or what I've done or where I'm going. It's not my job to assign a story to my life, or a judgment.- I no longer have to pretend to be something or hustle to gain love. I just need to love who is willing to love back. It's so simple.- I take all gurus, religions, indictments and gossip with quite a high level of benevolent skepticism, which allows me to be free from the fear that goes along with these stories.- I don't take myself as seriously as I used to.Probably the most valuable of all . . .- I have a deep compassion for all people. We are all just stuck here together, trying our hardest and doing our best. I don't have to hate someone because their best wasn't up to some story I tell myself. I don't' have to insist they believe in my story. I can just smile and listen and do what I can.",TRUE,25-04-2017,"Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2017",1878424319
262,The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom Book),Simple but deep philosophy with the grandest of aspirations,Emily,4,"The book has the boldest of aspirations, attempting to be in the peer set of sacred religious foundations such as The Bible. The author believes we create our own hell and, through practicing the ""agreements"" in this book, could instead create our own heaven. The core idea of reframing your mental state is well studied and backed up by science, but the degree to which these agreements fulfill such lofty ambitious is an open question. My take is that there's some wisdom that anyone could benefit from, but there's a cloud of poor editing the reader must pass through to access it.""The dream you are living is your creation. It is your perception of reality that you can change at any time. You have the power to create hell, and you have the power to create heaven.""Agreement 1: Be Impeccable With Your WordSimilar to the Buddhist eightfold path ""right speech"". They mean speech that doesn't go against yourself. This is both negative self-talk as well as unkind words towards others, because that comes back against us* If I see you in the street and I call you stupid, it appears that I‚Äôm using the word against you. But really I‚Äôm using my word against myself, because you‚Äôre going to hate me for this, and your hating me is not good for me.* Using the analogy of the human mind as a computer, gossip can be compared to a computer virus. A computer virus is a piece of computer language written in the same language all the other codes are written in, but with a harmful intent. This code is inserted into the program of your computer when you least expect it and most of the time without your awareness. After this code has been introduced, your computer doesn‚Äôt work quite right.* Impeccability of the word will also give you immunity from anyone putting a negative spell on you. You will only receive a negative idea if your mind is fertile ground for that idea.Agreement 2: Don't Take Anything Personally.Like David Foster Wallace's ""This is water"", we have a rather selfish view that the world revolves around us. Instead, we must love ourselves and refuse to take the ""poison"" others may inflict towards us.* Even when a situation seems so personal, even if others insult you directly, it has nothing to do with you. What they say, what they do, and the opinions they give are according to the agreements they have in their own minds.* Even the opinions you have about yourself are not necessarily true; therefore, you don‚Äôt need to take whatever you hear in your own mind personally.* All the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personally.Agreement 3: Don't Make Assumptions.We view the actions of others through a filter. Instead, we can practice mindfulness and accept things as they are without associating baggage.* We make assumptions about what others are doing or thinking ‚Äî we take it personally ‚Äî then we blame them and react by sending emotional poison with our word.* We only see what we want to see, and hear what we want to hear. We don‚Äôt perceive things the way they are.Agreement 4: Always Do Your Best.In every moment, give it your best. Even the seemingly inconsequential you now give your all. But note this is not about perfection, we are human and can accept our actions as long as we try our best.* When you overdo, you deplete your body and go against yourself, and it will take you longer to accomplish your goal. But if you do less than your best, you subject yourself to frustrations, self-judgment, guilt, and regrets.* If you don‚Äôt judge yourself there is no way you are going to suffer from guilt, blame, and self-punishment.* When you always do your best, you take action. Doing your best is taking the action because you love it, not because you‚Äôre expecting a reward.* When you do your best you learn to accept yourself. But you have to be aware and learn from your mistakes. Learning from your mistakes means you practice, look honestly at the results, and keep practicing.* You do your best because you want to do it, not because you have to do it, not because you are trying to please* I make everything a ritual, and I always do my best. Taking a shower is a ritual for me, and with that action I tell my body how much I love it.Quotes that provide a summary of the author's views* The best way to say, ‚ÄúThank you, God,‚Äù is by letting go of the past and living in the present moment, right here and now. Whatever life takes away from you, let it go.* The real you is still a little child who never grew up. Sometimes that little child comes out when you are having fun or playing, when you feel happy, when you are painting, or writing poetry, or playing the piano, or expressing yourself in some way. These are the happiest moments of your life ‚Äî when the real you comes out, when you don‚Äôt care about the past and you don‚Äôt worry about the future.* Develop awareness of all the self-limiting, fear-based beliefs that make you unhappy.* You achieve the Mastery of Transformation by changing the fear-based agreements that make you suffer, and reprogramming your own mind, in your own way.* Going to the core of those agreements is what I call going into the desert. When you go into the desert you meet your demons face-to-face. After coming out of the desert, all those demons become angels.* Happiness is a choice, and so is suffering.",TRUE,17-01-2021,"Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2021",1878424319

This book is an insightful gem that serves as a guide to living one's best life, filled with authenticity and personal freedom.Ruiz presents four simple but powerful principles that, when embraced and practiced, can transform the way we perceive ourselves and interact with others. The agreements are:Be impeccable with your word: This agreement emphasizes the importance of speaking with integrity and using our words to spread positivity, love, and truth. It made me realize the immense impact our words can have on ourselves and those around us.Don't take anything personally: This agreement reminded me that other people's opinions and actions are not a reflection of my worth. It taught me to detach from the opinions of others, freeing me from unnecessary suffering and allowing me to find inner peace.Don't make assumptions: This agreement encourages us to seek clarity and communicate openly instead of assuming things about others. It helped me realize how often misunderstandings and conflicts arise from making assumptions, and it inspired me to approach situations with curiosity and open-mindedness.Always do your best: This agreement is about giving our best effort in everything we do, regardless of the outcome. It taught me that true success is measured by the extent of our personal growth and the dedication we put into our endeavors.""The Four Agreements"" is written in a simple and accessible manner, making it easy to absorb and apply the teachings to daily life. Don Miguel Ruiz's wisdom shines through every page, and his storytelling style brings the concepts to life.

I expected there to be some further torture from afar from Nina. Wild how this was NOT the ending at all. Nor the story to be told. Turning the extraordinary husband into the true monster and discovering it was learned behavior all along from Evelyn‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt imagine what discipline she did to Cece when they were alone.

280,How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen,An Important Book on an Important Topic Taking a Much Needed Skill Building Focus,J.M. Ryan,5,"David Brooks is good at both reporting and synthesizing best current thinking. Here, in this new book, importantly, he is driven also by his own learning. I think of him as a reflective practitioner. A fellow traveler. This is a good book, not a great book. A 5 star rating, however, for cleat intent and effort. This is a ‚Äúbig tent‚Äù book full of breadcrumbs of learning and insight. A book that will be relevant and helpful for many. The best chapters go deep. A single topic unpacked like empathy. The chapters in Part 2 are substantive in this way. On the whole, however, the book goes wide (too wide) in addressing a broad range of both personal and public (civic) concerns. The civic focus requires separate treatment. Really, a separate book. Also, at times, this book is both over-written and under-written. A reporter‚Äôs dilemma. Hard to find the middle ground balancing theory and practice (stories). In brief, at a deeper level, I think the book lacks an idea architecture in many ways. There is no integrating framework offered. His ‚Äúilluminator‚Äù frame partially does this but it is not fleshed out and defined rigorously enough. The book is more akin to a reporter‚Äôs field learnings coupled with a graduate student‚Äôs enthusiasm. The book has a palpable sense of discovery about it and offers us the promise of learning and seeing in new ways. And, indeed, it does that. Brooks helps us us take stock and see in new ways. Learning these social skills and the ‚Äúseeing others‚Äù skills more fully, more attentively, that Brooks points to, however, is not easy. I would have liked him to go deeper explaining how these skills are acquired and deepened. That said, I applaud Brooks task and his field research and his own reflections. He is a good role model in both his personal and professional life in the quest for lived wisdom. See chapter 17, ‚Äúwhat is wisdom ?‚Äù. This is a well intended effort at pulling together this book and his learnings. Finally, his dedication to his deceased friend Peter Marks, his best friend, speaks volumes. Read chapter 10 and his poignant recollections of his friend. Pitch perfect writing found here.",TRUE,30-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 30, 2023",059323006X

282,How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen,Revolutionary!,Amazon Customer,5,"What would happen if we all took the time to understand another person truly? Beyond surface level but seeing that person's humanity on full display. Not judging, condemning, or suppressing but understanding. This is the question David Brooks answers in ""How to Know A Person.""Brooks wrote a book about a common humanity we all share which is the intrinsic need to be heard, valued, and understood. Each human being craves for this and we live in a culture that prevents that from occurring.Brooks effortlessly blends the fields of psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, ethics, and sociology to present a compelling case for human connection. We need each other and cannot live without interaction. Life would be very difficult without these essentials.This book doesn't talk about a new issue that has arisen but from ages past. However, what David achieves in this book is presenting a healthy alternative that will foster deep change in every sphere and domain of our lives. The antidote to tribalism, polarization, xenophobia, and the like is LOVE. It's simple yet profound. By truly getting to know another in all of their humanity, we love our neighbors deeply.This book is about more than just relationships but the art of loving people. How can we truly love someone to the point where they feel heard, valued, and understood? It only happens through deep empathic listening and compassion. Seeing the world through another's eyes while affirming their experiences.If we let it, this book can help start conversations that could revolutionize society for the common good. David Brooks speaks out of experience and not theoretically. I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels lonely, marginalized, neglected, or misunderstood.

He is not preachy, elitist or holier-than-thou about it‚Äîhe openly shares his struggles in connecting and understanding other people in a very well written narrative, including stories that clearly illustrate his points.I was afraid this would be too ‚Äútouchy feely‚Äù or academic to be of any use, but Brooks has such a thoughtful approach that it is more like learning from a friend or someone who has your best interest in mind.A very refreshing take on a common human problem: how do you really connect with someone else who is different from you? How do you understand people who disagree with you on politics, religion or other issues?It may be that the future of our country depends on solving some of these questions, so well worth a try.",TRUE,24-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",059323006X

290,The Very Hungry Caterpillar,A Timeless Classic That Nourishes the Mind!,Pretty,5,"The media could not be loaded. Where to even begin with Eric Carle's ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar""? This book has been a cornerstone of childhood for countless kids‚Äîand with good reason!First and foremost, the visual elements are stunning. Eric Carle‚Äôs unique collage technique brings the story to life in a way that instantly captures the attention of both young and older readers. His choice of bold, vibrant colors is just like eye-candy for the young ones.The tale itself is simple yet profound. A caterpillar eats its way through various foods, both healthy and not-so-healthy, growing bigger and ultimately transforming into a butterfly. On one level, it‚Äôs a delightful story about change and growth; on another, it subtly teaches children about the days of the week, counting, and nutrition.I appreciate how the book incorporates little ""holes"" in the pages to indicate where the caterpillar has munched through, adding a tactile element to the reading experience. My 5-year-old loves poking her fingers through the holes, making the story not just a visual but also a sensory delight!It‚Äôs also worth noting that the story is quick and to-the-point, making it perfect for bedtime or for little ones with shorter attention spans. But despite its brevity, it offers a wealth of topics to explore and discuss, from biology and metamorphosis to making healthier food choices.""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" isn't just a book; it's an interactive, educational experience that both children and adults can enjoy together.

320,"The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness",A Significant and Badly Needed Contribution to the Qualitative Part of our Financial Life.,Stephen S,4,"From the first sentence to the last, this book provides the latest and most up-to-date evidence for financial literacy's wholesome power to enrich your entire life. The author tells stories to discover financial literacy and living a good life go hand and hand. Most financial books discuss the dominated and respected quantitative side, the sophisticated science, complicated formulas, and mind-numbing statistics. Reading the traditional personal finance genres makes people erroneously think investors need to be intelligent and aggressive to invest successfully.The Psychology of Money is courageously different. It is about life first and finances second. Don‚Äôt we want to better understand our behavior, our sense of ourselves and what makes us tick so we can achieve that vibrant and contented life? I know I do.The author skillfully separates the easy part of discovering the investing process versus the hard part. This may shock newbies, but understanding the quantitative aspect of finances, such as constructing a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds, is the easy part. Look, it is not the little guy or gal versus the massively intimating stock market with the macho goal of beating the average returns. Instead, this book is about understanding our behavior and the decisions we make to achieve a balanced and calm life with accepting reasonable stock market returns. Now that‚Äôs the hard part! But this author makes understanding our behavior achievable and interesting. He accepts whatever skills, experience, or knowledge readers bring to the table.The author brings up an age-old adage that we have been taught by our elders for generations‚Äîdon‚Äôt take things so personally! With life's many challenges and sometimes negative surprises, isn't it about how we react that counts? Instead, if we respond with wisdom gained from our experiences over the long haul, the challenge itself will eventually be insignificant.The author explains that our reactive behavior, whether the sudden death of a loved one, a broken water pipe damaging our house, or a stock market crash, how we respond to each of these vastly different crises is no different. As a reviewer of this outstanding book, I took the liberty of interpreting the primary theme with my examples. With the death of a loved one, we can blame the doctors, the hospital, and isolate from friends and family, and sob over beers for the rest of your life as a lonely and bitter widow or widower, or you can blame the stock market, your broker, or valueless Wall Street for your portfolio loses. For example, it is well known that millions of investors reacted negatively for over a decade. They sat out with their two to three trillion of the longest bull market in history because they lost money in the 2008 financial crisis. So, no matter what the experience, isn't it always how we react? This book would help those unfortunate investors pull themselves and their portfolio together to get back in the market.To bring mindfulness to our reactions, the author talked about investors' emotions, attitude, and temperament. To be successful in this counterintuitive financial system is to be aware and insightful of this powerful psychological human potential‚Äîyour expectation of future returns. The Goldilocks Principle doesn't have too high return expectations or too low, but somewhere in between. But what is a reasonable expected return?The author reports one of the most significant FACTS of the entire book: The United States Stock Market Returns 6.8% after Inflation. Allow me to repeat, 6.8%.According to the author, our United States capitalistic system produces about 6.8% return minus inflation since the 1870s (3.1% average inflation generates a total return of 9.9%). It is the law of averages, and it is powerful if we know how to tap into it and to be 100% satisfied with average returns (It has been researched many times that too many investors fail to get average returns). Morgan explains how to harness this massive industry and what strategy will get you the average return. The goal is to earn the average return over many years. Why? Two reasons:1. 6.8% return over inflation is a great return!2. Because our emotions will be spared the negative reactions from the massive swings (volatility) of the stock market which will set you up to panic and ‚Äúget out.‚ÄùThis book will help you find that ""just right"" balance of your investments and your mind so you can sleep soundly with confidence and reach your financial goals over long periods of time. There is no get rich quick scheme. If a financial adviser or your best friend says that they can beat the averages, walk away, and never listen to that nonsense.Housel encourages all investors by debunking one debilitating myth from the start. All you need to be a successful investor is patience, think long term, and one tiny piece of mathematics, the power of compound interest over decades. You do not need an MBA or a high IQ! In fact, for the newbie financial reader with no financial background or smarts, take heart, you have an advantage. He wrote: ""Ordinary folks with no formal financial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.""That's me! I have never taken a financial course in my life. I flunked 2nd grade and I scored a lower than 100 IQ. But I had a huge advantage because I majored in psychology. Knowing how my mind functioned, I mitigated my return expectations of the market and drama during three of the biggest stock market crashes in history. My expectations for growth and losses are reasonable, balanced between stocks and fixed because I knew what the world-wide stock market returns since 1870. With my mind disciplined to stay the course forever and to do what I can do‚Äîcontrol the real deal by keeping expenses low and be extremely happy with reasonable returns. I have perfect control by paying myself instead of some Wall Street mucky muck's yacht.For years, seasoned investors poo-poo psychology (read the one and two-star reviews of this book). There is at least one huge exception. One of the most significant financial thinkers of the 20th century and the mentor and professor of Warren Buffett. Ben Graham wrote said in the very first paragraph of his monumental 623 page The Intelligent Investor, ""‚Ä¶little will be said here about the technique of analyzing securities; attention will be paid chiefly to investment principles and investors' attitudes."" (1973 revised, page 1).The author had the great wisdom to cite a book titled ‚ÄúEnough‚Äù by the legendary John Bogle. Morgan tells stories of people ""hit it big"" (IN THE BILLIONS!). It wasn‚Äôt ""enough."" They want more, and in the end, they lost it all. Bogle‚Äôs most famous quote to get the market averages mentioned previously is to invest in the ‚Äúentire haystack, do not look for the needle.‚ÄùThe author makes an important statement that is long overdue and worth repeating‚Äîthe qualitative discussions of investing is more complicated than the quantitative discussions. It is humans that make the decisions and do all the trading on the stock exchanges throughout the world. Last I heard, humans have feelings. Housel says that science is exact and is governed by predictable physical laws. Molecules and atoms do not have feelings! But millions of investors do! Sir Isaac Newton would agree. He famously lamented after losing his investments to the South Sea Disaster in the 18th century, ""I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people."" Knowledge of psychology and behavior will help you understand and protect yourself from the ""madness of people.""The author covers a lot of ground because there is a lot of human behavioral and psychological constructs to explain. Luck vs. skill, attitude vs. math, being average vs. being superior, uncertainty vs. certainty, and confidence born from wisdom vs. overconfidence born from recklessness are impossible to measure and explain. The author correctly labeled these constructs ‚Äúsoft skills‚Äù (Hard skills are the math, statistics, graphs, and tables). Luck, attitude, accepting average returns, uncertainty, long-term horizon, and overconfidence are difficult to explain without emotional pushback from some investors. Most seasoned investors want to be intelligent, act aggressive, appear confident, and look sophisticated and soft skills will not get them that image and beat the market.We love to think successes originated on skills, knowledge, intelligence, spreadsheets, and math. The most vital reaction to many seasoned investors is downplaying luck to investment success. But Morgan won't have it. Making money from stock and bond investing is being smart with the complicated reality we face, and spreadsheet knowledge will not be enough. That being lucky is part of the equation. He admits that the luck factor is the question that might not be answered in our lifetimes.In the meantime, there is nothing wrong with being lucky. The returns are green too. But most seasoned investors feel insulted. Warren Buffett always reports that he is an incredibly fortunate investor born in the United States. I am lucky that I am alive after contracting stage two colon cancer twenty years ago. Any one of us could have been born in a small village in India in abject poverty, a shantytown in Lima, Peru, or one of our country's public housing projects.Unfortunately, I gave the book four stars. There was one paragraph that does not belong in the book. I was disappointed. I agree that I might be petty, but that paragraph doesn‚Äôt make any sense because it doesn‚Äôt follow the narrative throughout. On page 218, I rewrote here for those who use the indexing strategy, especially Bogleheads:‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean index investing will always work. It doesn‚Äôt mean it is for everyone. And it doesn‚Äôt mean active stock picking is doomed to fail. In general, this industry has become too entrenched on one side or the other‚Äîparticularly those vehemently against active investing.‚ÄùDid the Author Lose His ‚ÄúPsychology‚Äù for a Moment?I scratched my head and seriously wondered, has the author lost his mind? What in the world motivated the author had to write this when he shares how he invests, and it‚Äôs just like most Bogleheads and myself invest with low-cost index funds? I believe I can speak for most Bogleheads: of course, we are ‚Äúvehemently against active investing!‚Äù It‚Äôs expensive and flawed is thoroughly agreed upon by genuine fiduciary financial advisers. Furthermore, there are books, peer-reviewed academic articles, and the Bogleheads‚Äô forum experiences of how successful the indexing strategy has been overactive management. The author admits on the following page that 85% of active managers fail to beat the averages! The active management strategy has been proven dead for decades, and the author‚Äôs stories debunk active management. Over 35 million investors have their seven trillion dollars with Vanguard and TIAA. We know that active managers from Wall Street‚Äôs big banks and brokerage firms spend a lot of time sipping martinis on their yachts.Other than that hideous paragraph, The Psychology of Money is a fine book because it makes a huge contribution to financial discussions and what it means to be financially literate. The qualitative argument of financial literacy is desperately needed in the financial world. The quantitative argument is appropriate for constructing your portfolio and understanding how markets only return 6.8% average for 150 years. I learned a ton by reading those books too. But after that, no amount of math, sophistication, financial engineering, or science will protect investors from a bear market. Only what is between our ears will. Investors must get our heads behind the idea that we are up against a massive industry that wants to use our money to make money for themselves.The industry is playing a totally different game, different motivation, and most important different life values‚Äîthey spend 24/7 in front of their powerful computers trading for two goals only, bonuses and beating the averages. I have one more example of luck--We are lucky that Morgan Housel wrote this important work. It is not about looking at your finances 24/7, searching for that investment ‚Äúgem‚Äù that will make you rich quickly or to compete. At the end of the day, it is about doing our part in making the world a better place than it is now, being generous to those in need, be part of something bigger than yourself, and spending quality time with family and friends.",TRUE,11-11-2020,"Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2020",857197681
321,"The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness",Timeless nuggets of wisdom,Larry Frank,5,"Psycholology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed and Happiness by Morgan Housel is a timeless work about how our feelings, emotions and interactions with money often results in different outcomes for different people ‚Äì because people are different. So, insights into how to think and behave about money is instructive.You may think you don‚Äôt have enough money to make a difference for your future. I think this book will show you, how even with those thoughts, that you can.Others may believe they have more than enough. Those too are risky thoughts and beliefs.Because people are different, everyone should read this book to see what you uniquely learn about yourself and how you should think about money.Chocked full of great insights to guide us all.Quotes that hit home from various chapters are presented below. There are many more quotes possible, but then you‚Äôd miss the message between each quote. I strongly suggest getting the book to see how these below snippets string together into a powerful story about how we think and behave towards money matters.Quote:‚Ä¢ Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what‚Äôs happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.‚Ä¢ Luck and risk are siblings.‚Ä¢ Yes, but I have something he will never have ‚Ä¶ enough.‚Ä¢ There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don‚Äôt have and don‚Äôt need.‚Ä¢ The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.‚Ä¢ $81.5 billion of Warren Buffett‚Äôs $84.5 billion net worth came after his 65th birthday.‚Ä¢ Buffett began serious investing when he was 10 years old.‚Ä¢ His skill is investing, but his secret is time. That‚Äôs how compounding works.‚Ä¢ But good investing isn‚Äôt necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can‚Äôt be repeated. It‚Äôs about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That‚Äôs when compounding runs wild.‚Ä¢ Getting wealthy vs. staying wealthy.‚Ä¢ Getting money is one thing. Keeping it is another.‚Ä¢ Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.‚Ä¢ No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are.‚Ä¢ When you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, ‚ÄúWow, the guy driving that car is cool.‚Äù Instead, you think, ‚ÄúWow, if I had that car people would think I‚Äôm cool.‚Äù‚Ä¢ Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will.‚Ä¢ Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.‚Ä¢ Money has many ironies. Here‚Äôs an important one: Wealth is what you don‚Äôt see.‚Ä¢ Past a certain level of income people fall into three groups: Those who save, those who don‚Äôt think they can save, and those who don‚Äôt think they need to save.‚Ä¢ Building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate.‚Ä¢ The value of wealth is relative to what you need.‚Ä¢ Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.‚Ä¢ People‚Äôs ability to save is more in their control than they might think.‚Ä¢ Things that have never happened before happen all the time.‚Ä¢ The thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is how easy it is to underestimate how things compound. How, for example, 9/11 prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which helped drive the housing bubble, which led to the financial crisis, which led to a poor jobs market, which led to tens of millions to seek a college education, which led to [over a trillion dollars] in student loans with [a high percentage of default rates].‚Ä¢ The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising.‚Ä¢ The most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan.‚Ä¢ The purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary.‚Ä¢ The End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the tendency for people to be keenly aware of how much they‚Äôve changed in the past, but to underestimate how much their personalities, desires and goals are likely to change in the future. [Thus, their history of change won‚Äôt change anymore into their future].‚Ä¢ Every job looks easy when you‚Äôre not the one doing it.‚Ä¢ Successful investing looks easy when you‚Äôre not the one doing it. Hold stocks for the long run ‚Ä¶ but do you know how hard it is to maintain a long-term outlook when stocks are collapsing?‚Ä¢ Price ‚Ä¶ not dollars and cents ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty ‚Ä¶ all of which are easy to overlook until you‚Äôre dealing with them in real time.‚Ä¢ Beware of taking financial cues from people playing a different game than you are.‚Ä¢ When investors have different goals and time horizons ‚Äì and they do in every asset class ‚Äì prices that look ridiculous to one person can make sense to another, because the factors those investors pay attention to are different.‚Ä¢ The interesting thing about [absolutely pessimistic] stories is that their polar opposite ‚Äì forecasts of outrageous optimism ‚Äì are rarely taken as seriously as prophets of doom.‚Ä¢ Pessimism just sounds smarter and more plausible than optimism.‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¶progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.‚Ä¢ The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true.‚Ä¢ We don‚Äôt know what we don‚Äôt know.‚Ä¢ Coming to terms with how much you don‚Äôt know means coming to terms with how much of what happens in the world is out of your control. And that can be hard to accept.‚Ä¢ Less ego, more wealth.‚Ä¢ If you want to to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon.Unquote.There‚Äôs a lot of wisdom alone in the various quotes above. There‚Äôs even more wisdom reading how they string together to see the larger story line to understand your psychology of money applied in your own life.Each person reading Housel‚Äôs work will get something different out of it than someone else.

328,"The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness","Spend more time in pursuit of small, personally appealing adventures and interests",Fascinated  explorer,4,"Housel is an award winning business writer with investing experience. He covers a number of topics in investing with a slightly different slant. He makes a good argument that many of us would be happier or more satisfied if we spend more time in pursuit of small, personally appealing adventures and interests instead of pursuing more money.He quotes successful people on how they achieve balance. For instance Harry Moskowitz, Nobel prize winner in economics for his work on risk and reward, said that deciding how much of his funds to put into the stock market he visualized his grief if the stock market went way up and he wasn't in it, or if it went way down and he was completely in it. So he split his contributions 50-50 between bonds and in equities.Examples of other famous investors such as Warren Buffett who has one of the best investment records available. He points out that one of the reasons for his great wealth is that he invested very early and has kept the money compounding over a very long period of time -close to 80 years. Besides being very, very wealthy Buffett still tap dances to work, and has shown he still has the ability to learn new tricks in investing.Part of the way he did this was to hang onto investments for long periods of time, even with his exceptional skill at picking stocks and businesses it turns out that only about 10 of 3-400 hundred of investments resulted in very large profits. It takes special ability to have large profits in a given investment and to continue to hold it even while it goes up and down. The author doesn't give you much help in how to accomplish this feat.Another point is you get wealthy not by spending most of your money, but by saving most of your money and letting it compound over long periods of time. How much do you invest and how much risk do you take with most of the money depends on knowing yourself. Do you want to be in a position where you have enough cash so if the market goes down heavily and you have the courage, you can invest that money in the investment you're interested in? This is contrary to what most people do who are relatively fully invested near the top and then sell investments as the market goes down. They are losing too much and sell usually at a substantially lower price than they bought the investment. So you have to have enough money invested so that over the long term that it goes up enough to make you wealthier, but not so much that you decide that you've lost too much and sell at a big loss. Added to the problem is the fact that just because a company has bounced up and down before doesn't necessarily guarantee that it's going to bounce back again. Using low cost index funds generally evens out the ups and downs to some degree.Knowledge of the history of economic investment results is helpful, but fails to predict what is actually going to happen in the future. Part of being an investor is being able to predict how you are going to react to the worst and the best things that can happen to your investments. One of the most important attributes is the ability to change your mind as the world around you changes. The author includes many examples of how famous investors have coped with various problems and are quite informative.Perhaps the most valuable lesson or example is the author and his wife decided early in their careers that economic freedom, that is enough money to make their own choices later in life was worth doing. They could live comfortably without the joy of doing everything you want immediately. Instead they saved all of the raises they've gotten over the years of their income. He doesn't give actual numbers or even percentages for savings, but they are well towards their goal of complete financial independence. A great feeling if you can do it without sacrificing things that you really enjoy. Like the author perhaps you enjoy reading, walking, and podcasts- it's a good start.His method is to invest in low cost index funds, Vanguard, and basically hold forever or until his family retires. A large part of my own portfolio follows the same plan and this has worked very well. Hope you all achieve it.",TRUE,12-05-2021,"Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2021",857197681

330,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel,5/5 A True Masterpiece,melanie (meltotheany / jtotheimin),5,"‚ÄúI spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much I loved her.‚ÄùThis is one of the best books I‚Äôve ever had the privilege to read. It is probably in the top five for best books I‚Äôve ever read in my entire life. I have been looking for a book like this my entire life, and no combination of words I‚Äôm about to type, and you‚Äôre about to read, is going to do this masterpiece justice. But I will say that Gabby, Joce, Amelie, and Elyse were all right, and I‚Äôm so happy I listened to them, because this book is worth every single ounce of hype.And when I say that this book is lifechanging, I truly mean it. This book is sold as a historical romance, where you learn about a fictional, famous, old Hollywood actress and all her marriages. What you get is a book that stars a bisexual, Cuban woman who was never allowed to talk about the love of her life; her wife. And when I say I cried during this book, I truly mean that I probably need to buy a new copy because I was the biggest mess you‚Äôve ever seen.‚ÄúAnd it will be the tragedy of my life that I cannot love you enough to make you mine. That you cannot be loved enough to be anyone‚Äôs.‚ÄùOn top of this being a powerful book about race, sexuality, misogyny, and having to conform to societies norms, the true meaning I took from this book is that life is short, so damn short, and we shouldn‚Äôt spend it pretending to be something we aren‚Äôt. And we shouldn‚Äôt spend it doing anything less than loving the people who are worthy and deserving of our love.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt need boys in order to feel good. And that realization gave me great power.‚ÄùWe follow Evelyn from the very start; losing her mother very young, her body developing very quickly, noticing others noticing her developing body, marrying a man so she can leave the dead-end city she grew up in, so she can become something more. Evelyn is unapologetic with her actions, and it is one of the most empowering things I‚Äôve ever read. She plays so many more parts than the roles she is cast in. And Evelyn learns really quickly how to play each and every man she is forced to interact with, and she quickly learns what she can gain from each and every one of them, too.This story is told from two different timelines and two different points of view. One from Monique Grant, who is a biracial (white and African-American) woman who is going through a fresh divorce and trying to make something of herself in the journalism field. And her life changes the day her editor tells her how Evelyn Hugo is demanding her, and only her, to write something for her.‚ÄúHeartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.‚ÄùThe other timeline(s) are all the different times in Evelyn‚Äôs life, and the different seven husbands that she had, while she is recounting the events that lead her to be telling Monique this story. Evelyn has lived a very full life, and is in her late seventies now, and is finally ready to talk about her life. But the entire book we are guessing why she has chosen only Monique for this job.‚ÄúMake them pay you what they would pay a white man.‚ÄùIf you guys have been following my reviews, you‚Äôll probably know that I talk about found family and how important it is to me a lot, but The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is the epitome of how beautiful a found family can be. Evelyn and Harry‚Äôs friendship in this was one of the most beautiful things I‚Äôve ever read in my entire reading life.‚ÄúWhen you write the ending, Monique, make sure the reader understands that all I was ever really looking for was family. Make sure it‚Äôs clear that I found it. Make sure they know that I am heartbroken without it.‚ÄùAnd the romance? The true romance in this book is the most romantic thing I have ever read in my entire life. And you guys know I‚Äôve read a ton of romances, but they are all lesser to this. Every single one of them can‚Äôt compare with the romance in this book. I feel like every time I‚Äôve used the word ‚Äúperfect‚Äù to describe something that wasn‚Äôt the romance in this book, then I used the word wrong.‚ÄúPlease never forget that the sun rises and sets with your smile. At least to me it does. You‚Äôre the only thing on this planet worth worshipping.‚ÄùHow many Evelyn and Celias are there in the world? How many are still playing the role that Evelyn was forced to play? I cry for every single person who must hide who they are, and who they want to love. And this book talks about many big things in LGBTQIAP+ history; from the Stonewall riots to the disgusting Reagan administration, but life still isn't anywhere close to equal in 2018. The prejudices, the discrimination, the virus/syndrome blaming, the looks I‚Äôve experienced holding a girl‚Äôs hand while walking into a restaurant? Those are still in 2018, in the United States, but people act like none of those things exists because marriage is legalized, begrudgingly. I‚Äôm not writing this review to get on my soapbox, but I promise, we have a lot more work to do. And this book, this book lit a fire under me.I personally identify as pansexual, but I felt like the bisexual rep in this was a tier above anything my eyes have ever seen. Seeing Evelyn love all the parts of her, and all the different parts of her love, was something so awe-inspiring. I am still so overwhelmed with feelings, but if you identify as bi or pan, this is a love letter to you, I promise.‚ÄúI was a lesbian when she loved me and a straight woman when she hated me.‚ÄùThis book also focuses a huge importance on motherhood throughout the entirety of this book, and then I read the acknowledgement and started weeping all over again. Taylor Jenkins Reid was able to evoke the strongest emotions from me, and I just pray that things will be different for the generation of kids being raised right now.This was the first thing I‚Äôve read by Taylor Jenkins Reid, but I will buy every single new thing she produces. The writing was so lyrical and addicting. I mean, I have a quote between almost every paragraph. This whole book deserves to be highlighted. The characters, well, my mind has now forever imagined that these are real people now, so there is that. The topics, themes, and discussions are beyond important. This book just makes me feel so passionately. This book is one of the most empowering pieces of literature I‚Äôve ever consumed. And I am not the same person I was before this book.‚ÄúI told her every single day that her life had been the world‚Äôs greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.‚ÄùIf you guys ever take a recommendation from me; please have it be The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Please, I‚Äôm actually begging you. I promise, this book is lifechanging, and I equally promise you that this book changed mine. There is magic between these four-hundred-pages. Pure magic. This story is addicting, enthralling, and so important. And if you‚Äôre an Evelyn, in 2018, I see you, but I hope it doesn‚Äôt take you as long as it took her to be happy. This will forever be one of the best books of my life, and I‚Äôll cherish it forever.‚ÄúPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth.

331,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel,THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO: Mason's Review,Madison,4,"‚ÄúPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.‚ÄùTaylor Jenkins Reid‚Äôs THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO tells the authentic story of legendary Hollywood actress Evelyn Hugo through an autobiographical medium, with ambitious ‚ÄúVivant‚Äù journalist Monique Grant scribing her tale. Throughout the interview, Hugo reveals the behind-the-scenes secrets of her life acting in the film industry, detailing how she repressed her Cuban heritage to conform to the Hollywood scene, how she not only experienced but capitalized on the industry‚Äôs sexism and double standards, how she used her body and married famous men to get her to the top, how she found true friendship and forbidden love, and how she admits that she would do it all again if given a chance. As Hugo engrosses Grant and the readers with her story, the question of ‚Äòwhy would a famous Hollywood actress want to speak with an up-and-coming journalist like Monique Grant, why her?‚Äô lingers in the back of our minds, and soon, we learn the real reason why Hugo wanted Grant to write her autobiography. As a student enrolled in an Intermediate Fiction Writing course, I was particularly eager to review this novel after reading it for the first time last year. To say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading it is an understatement.Taylor Jenkins Reid never fails to impress me with her craft in creating and developing characters, I find that to be a strong element of the novel that contributed to my appeal; Evelyn Hugo is one of the most compelling protagonists I have ever read about in my entire life, and I adored the fact that she was all morally shades of grey and not a good person when it came to her rise to the top of the Hollywood ladder. She felt no regrets about the manipulations and schemes she created to get her to the singularity, which thrilled me, but seeing her vulnerable side away from the flashing cameras was also a real treat. Harry Cameron and Celia St. James serve as strong secondary characters who held a major influence on Hugo; one whom she shared a deep platonic connection with, and the other, to whom she was helplessly in love with and devoted. Taylor Jenkins Reid wonderfully illustrates the ups and downs of the friendship between Evelyn and Harry, the struggles and clashes between Evelyn and Celia, and the tragedy Evelyn experienced losing them both.Another element that stood out to me was the setting of the novel. Hugo‚Äôs interview reveals how she built and stepped away from her career as a renowned Hollywood actress, often inspiring her to move across different locations to preserve her private image. To her detriment and benefit, the press follows Hugo wherever she goes, with journalist companies like ‚ÄúSub Rosa,‚Äù ‚ÄúPhotoMoment,‚Äù ‚ÄúHollywood Digest,‚Äù and the ‚ÄúNew York Tribune‚Äù writing articles about her fabricated life (while not realizing it), and spreading gossip. Seeing those newspaper clippings pop up in the chapters gives the novel a sparkling touch, making the environment feel more authentic. It also is no surprise that Taylor Jenkins Reid took inspiration from Old Hollywood icons such as Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor to craft the character of Evelyn Hugo; she fits right into the time period where her story blossoms.Finally, the last element that stood out to me above all else was Evelyn‚Äôs plot arc. She goes from feeling determined to make it to the singularity and steal the audience's attention to wanting to give it all up for Celia St. James, the love of her life, in a way that feels so natural and real. Her wanting to build an image as a renowned actress came from wanting to get out of Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and prove to people, especially her abusive father, that she has the talent and worth to make it big. But, as she meets and falls for Celia, she feels compelled to spend every moment with her, and she keeps up her work ethic but hides her feelings so the career she sacrificed so much of her authentic self for doesn‚Äôt die in vain. Of course, that comes with hardships in her relationship with Celia, but we see how her decision to leave all of the Hollywood glory behind makes sense after the fact. It‚Äôs bittersweet.If you‚Äôre in the market for a juicy contemporary beach read or a compelling novel that handles serious topics elegantly, THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO is worth a read and is the book for you.",TRUE,27-04-2023,"Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2023",1501161938

Along with the simple complexity of just being human. This book covers the story of a woman from 13 years old to her death at 79 and everything that happened in between including what leads her to Monique Grant to write her memoirs, ending the book with a connection between the two you will never see coming.

335,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel,Hollywood hasn't changed much,Chelscey,5,"Starting at the young age of fourteen and ending when she‚Äôs seventy-nine (when we first meet Evelyn), Evelyn Hugo has gone from bombshell, to sexpot, to Oscar winner, to civil rights supporter. Evelyn knew what she wanted from an early age‚Äîto get out of Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and away from her abusive father, and to be the biggest star anyone has ever heard of. And she accomplished that! Partially because of her talent, partially because she knows her worth and is unafraid to get dirty in order to achieve her goals, and partially because there is no one better at using the press and scandals to serve their own interests. Evelyn is both a force to be reckoned with, but also a deeply flawed and lonely. Shown through the perspective of Evelyn as she dictates her memoir to Monique, the reader is taken back to the early days of Hollywood to watch Evelyn‚Äôs rise, and her stumbles, to and through stardom. For a story about a Hollywood starlet, this book is LAYERED, and I don‚Äôt think I was expecting the level of depth it had, even though many reviews warned me to expect the unexpected with this story.In order to become Evelyn Hugo, Hollywood‚Äôs biggest star, Evelyn had to let go of who she was; erasing her identity to be what Hollywood wanted her to be. She knew and accepted this, always, but it does break your heart a little to watch her identity get stripped away so that she could be the blonde bombshell the screen so loved. The things Evelyn hid or changed, often denying the realest parts of herself in the process, really hit me in the feels, and there were parts at the end of the book that had me welling up with tears if that tells you anything. I won‚Äôt say more because the way the story unfolds is really lovely with getting to know all 7 of Evelyn‚Äôs husbands and the roles they played in her life, but I will say that I LOVED the inclusion of the fake articles to show the juxtaposition between what was Evelyn‚Äôs reality versus what the public got to see, and how the press portrayed her in return.Honestly, there was very little I did not like about this book, or its story. It flowed beautifully and, while not necessarily one of those books you couldn‚Äôt put down (I had no issues stopping in reading for the night) it was never dull. It had a smooth, and highly enjoyable writing style. However, my only issues were that sometimes, with the book being told in 1st person, Monique didn‚Äôt always feel that distinct to me from Evelyn. Which may be mostly because we don‚Äôt really get to know Monique at the same level at which we get to know Evelyn, though I did enjoy their relationship and how they were able to help each other, even when that got . . . tricky, to say the least. But I also didn‚Äôt like Celia for a majority of the book, either. I found her to be so frustrating at times, that I often wondered why Evelyn even bothered having her around. Thankfully that changed toward the end, but still.But, all in all, I LOVED this book and this story. It was so empowering, watching Evelyn be so unashamed to own her beauty, her sex appeal, her confidence, and to be the ball-buster she was, so unafraid of telling people what she wants, what she deserves‚Äîall because she knows her worth. I didn‚Äôt know how much I needed a story, to see a woman like that, until I read this book. But I also loved that the author didn‚Äôt shy away from Evelyn‚Äôs flaws, or the fact that, for a lot of Evelyn‚Äôs life, she was deeply lonely. Evelyn wasn‚Äôt perfect, but she didn‚Äôt let that be an excuse for anyone to treat her poorly. I will say there are some instances of spousal abuse in this book though, so just be forewarned if that kind of trauma is sensitive for you. I thought the author handled those topics amazingly well, but I‚Äôve also never experienced such things for myself, either. Because this book brought tears to my eyes with that whole last third of the story, it easily gets 5 stars from me! This is such a satisfying, and empowering book!",TRUE,25-04-2022,"Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2022",1501161938

350,Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity,"Wonderful mix of facts, sound medical advice, anecdotes and opinions for living a long healthy life",G. C. Carter,5,"This 2023 book ‚ÄúOutlive: The Science and Art of Longevity‚Äù by Peter Attia, M.D. (with acknowledged contributions by others including Bill Gifford) is a wonderful mix of facts, medical advice, personal and family anecdotes and opinions for living a long life that you, your friends, relatives, and medical professionals will enjoy. One main recommendation is to exercise regularly (in specific ways) while avoiding injury. He recommends particular medical tests. The book is worth purchasing and reading to understand how to live a longer healthier life. As an example of the substance and style of this book, Attia writes: ‚ÄúThe information and advice presented in this book are not meant to substitute for the advice of your family‚Äôs physician or other trained healthcare professionals. You are advised to consult with healthcare professionals with regard to all matters pertaining to you and your family‚Äôs health and well-being.‚Äù Attia writes: ‚Äúas a surgical resident at Johns Hopkins, I would learn that death comes at two speeds: fast and slow‚Ä¶ Ultimately‚Ä¶ slow deaths ended up bothering me even more. But this is not a book about death‚Ä¶ [but about] longevity‚Ä¶ Longevity does not‚Ä¶ mean merely notching more and more birthdays as we slowly wither away‚Ä¶ In 1900, life expectancy hovered somewhere south of age fifty, and most people were likely to die from ‚Äúfast‚Äù causes: accidents, injuries, and infectious diseases‚Ä¶ the odds are overwhelming that you will die as a result of one of the chronic diseases of aging that I call the Four Horsemen: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction‚Ä¶ Longevity has two components. how long you live‚Ä¶ [and] the quality of your years‚Ä¶ called healthspan‚Ä¶ defined as the period of life when we are free from disability or disease‚Ä¶ Death rates from cancer, on the other hand, have hardly budged in the more than fifty years since the War on Cancer was declared, despite hundreds of billions of dollars‚Äô worth of‚Ä¶ spending on research. Type 2 diabetes remains a raging public health crisis, showing no sign of abating, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and related neurodegenerative diseases stalk our growing elderly population‚Ä¶ None of our treatments for late-stage lung cancer has reduced mortality by nearly as much as the worldwide reduction in smoking that has occurred over the last two decades, thanks in part to widespread smoking bans. This simple preventive measure (not smoking) has saved more lives than any late-stage intervention that medicine has devised‚Ä¶ Medicine‚Äôs biggest failing is [treating] all these conditions‚Ä¶ after they are entrenched‚Äîrather than before they take root.‚Äù Attia writes: ‚ÄúThe metabolic derangement that leads to type 2 diabetes also helps foster and promote heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease‚Ä¶ all ‚Äúdiets‚Äù are similar‚Ä¶ protein becomes critically important as we age‚Ä¶ Exercise is by far the most potent longevity ‚Äúdrug.‚Äù No other intervention does nearly as much to prolong our lifespan and preserve our cognitive and physical function. But most‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt do nearly enough‚Äîand exercising the wrong way can do as much harm as good‚Ä¶‚Äù Attia writes: ‚Äúthere have been two distinct eras in medical history, and [we are] on the verge of a third‚Ä¶ Hippocrates‚Äôs major contribution was the insight that diseases are caused by nature and not by‚Ä¶ the gods‚Ä¶ Medicine 2.0 arrived in the mid-nineteenth century with the advent of the germ theory of disease... [and] eradicated deadly diseases such as polio and smallpox‚Ä¶ Yet Medicine 2.0 has proved far less successful against long-term diseases such as cancer‚Ä¶ lifespans have nearly doubled since the late 1800s, [almost] entirely from antibiotics and improved sanitation... if you subtract out deaths from the eight top infectious diseases‚Ä¶ overall mortality rates declined relatively little over the course of the twentieth century‚Ä¶ [The goal of] Medicine 3.0‚Äîis‚Ä¶ to be thriving‚Ä¶ throughout the latter half of our lives‚Ä¶ Lifespan‚Ä¶ is binary: you‚Äôre alive, and then you‚Äôre dead. It‚Äôs final. But before that happens‚Ä¶ most people suffer through a period of decline that‚Ä¶ is like dying in slow motion‚Ä¶ while actual death is inevitable, this deterioration‚Ä¶ is less so‚Ä¶ If you increase your muscle strength and improve your cardiorespiratory fitness, you have also reduced your risk of dying‚Ä¶‚Äù Attia writes: ‚Äú[Exercise] components [are]: strength, stability, aerobic efficiency, and peak aerobic capacity. We want to maintain physical strength, stamina, stability across a broad range of movements, while remaining free from pain and disability‚Ä¶ exercise [is] the most potent longevity ‚Äúdrug‚Äù in our arsenal, in terms of lifespan and healthspan. The data are unambiguous: exercise not only delays actual death but also prevents both cognitive and physical decline, better than any other intervention‚Ä¶‚Äù Attia writes: ‚Äúdata comes from studies of‚Ä¶ people who have lived to the age of one hundred and beyond, often in good health‚Ä¶ many of them get to enjoy one, or two, or even three Bonus Decades‚Ä¶. Researchers‚Ä¶ [found that] individuals [had] very little in common with one another genetically‚Ä¶ Natural selection has endowed us with genes that work beautifully to help us develop, reproduce, and then raise our offspring [but] after the age of reproduction, natural selection loses much of its force‚Ä¶ [Yet] a handful of potential longevity genes‚Ä¶ are possibly relevant to our strategy. One [gene]‚Ä¶ called ‚Ä¶ APOE (apolipoprotein E) that is involved in cholesterol transport and processing, and it has three variants: e2, e3, and e4‚Ä¶ The e2 variant of APOE‚Ä¶ seems to protect its carriers against dementia‚Äîand it also turns out to be very highly associated with longevity‚Ä¶ FOXO3 belongs to a family of ‚Äútranscription factors,‚Äù which regulate how other genes are expressed‚Äîmeaning whether they are activated or ‚Äúsilenced.‚Äù‚Ä¶ When FOXO3 is activated, it in turn activates genes that generally keep our cells healthier. It seems to play an important role in preventing cells from becoming cancerous as well.‚Äù Attia writes: ‚Äúgene expression can be influenced by your environment and your behaviors‚Ä¶ a 2007 study found that older people who were put on a regular exercise program shifted to a more youthful pattern of gene expression after six months. This suggests that genetics and environment both play a role in longevity and that it may be possible to implement interventions that replicate at least some of the centenarians‚Äô good genetic luck‚Ä¶ think of centenarians as the results of a natural experiment that tells us something important about living longer and living better‚Ä¶ The experiment entails taking a random collection of human genomes and exposing them to a variety of environments and behaviors. The centenarians possess the correct combination of genome X required to survive in environment Y (perhaps with help from behaviors Z).‚Äù Attia writes: ‚ÄúProtein aggregates have been implicated in diseases such as Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, so getting rid of them is good; impaired autophagy has been linked to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease‚Ä¶ and also to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson‚Äôs disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders‚Ä¶ By cleansing our cells of damaged proteins and other cellular junk, autophagy allows cells to run more cleanly and efficiently and helps make them more resistant to stress‚Ä¶ The FDA has given the green light for a clinical trial of another drug with potential longevity benefits, the diabetes medication metformin‚Ä¶ studies appeared to confirm‚Ä¶ that patients on metformin appeared to have a lower incidence of cancer than the general population‚Ä¶ diabetics on metformin actually lived longer than nondiabetics[striking!].‚Äù Attia writes: ‚ÄúIn the late 1970s, the average American adult male weighed 173 pounds. Now the average American man tips the scale at nearly 200 pounds‚Ä¶ According to the [CDC] more than 40 percent of the US population is obese‚Ä¶ another third‚Ä¶ is overweight (BMI of 25 to 30)‚Ä¶ visceral fat is linked to increased risk of both cancer and cardiovascular disease‚Ä¶ fat-storage capacity seems to be influenced by genetic factors‚Ä¶ our metabolism, as it has evolved over millennia, is not equipped to cope with our ultramodern diet, which has appeared only within the last century or so‚Ä¶ We needed to‚Ä¶ endure periods of time without much food, and natural selection obliged, endowing us with genes that helped us conserve and store energy in the form of fat‚Ä¶ to survive periods of famine, cold climates, and‚Ä¶ illness and pregnancy.‚Äù Attia writes: ‚ÄúAt some point, our primate ancestors underwent a random genetic mutation that effectively switched on their ability to turn fructose into fat‚Ä¶ This newfound ability to store fat enabled them to survive in the colder climate‚Ä¶ But in our modern world, this fat-storage mechanism has outlived its usefulness‚Ä¶ It is very difficult to get fat from eating too many apples, for example, because the fructose in the apple enters our system relatively slowly, mixed with fiber and water, and [we] can handle it normally‚Ä¶ I test my patients‚Äô levels of uric acid, not only because high levels may promote fat storage but also because it is linked to high blood pressure‚Ä¶ While heart disease is the most prevalent age-related condition, it is also more easily prevented than either cancer or Alzheimer‚Äôs disease‚Ä¶ atherosclerotic disease‚Ä¶ still kills more people than cancer in the [US] each year‚Ä¶ Heart disease remains our deadliest killer, ‚Ä¶ [but] this should be the tenth leading cause of death, not the first.‚Äù Attia writes: ‚ÄúThe reason they‚Äôre called high-and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL, respectively) has to do with the amount of fat relative to protein that each one carries... it‚Äôs not the cholesterol per se that causes problems but the nature of the particle in which it‚Äôs transported‚Ä¶ Another major misconception about heart disease is that it is somehow caused by the cholesterol that we eat in our diet‚Ä¶ The humble egg‚Ä¶ has remained in nutritional purgatory for decades, even after reams of research papers showing that dietary cholesterol (and particularly egg consumption) may not have much to do with heart disease at all‚Ä¶ The vast majority of the cholesterol in our circulation is actually produced by our own cells‚Ä¶ dietary guidelines finally‚Ä¶ conceded (in 2015) that ‚Äúcholesterol is not a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.‚Äù Glad we settled that‚Ä¶ the American Heart Association guidelines still favor LDL-C testing instead of apoB. I have all my patients tested for apoB regularly, and you should ask for the same test the next time you see your doctor‚Ä¶ We are fortunate that many of these conditions can be modulated or nearly eliminated‚Äîincluding apoB, by the way‚Äîvia lifestyle changes and medications‚Ä¶ I take a very hard line on lowering apoB, the particle that causes all this trouble. (In short: get it as low as possible, as early as possible.)‚Ä¶ if we all maintained the apoB levels we had when we were babies, there wouldn‚Äôt be enough heart disease on the planet for people to know what it was‚Ä¶ In my clinical experience, about a third to half of people who consume high amounts of saturated fats‚Ä¶ will experience a dramatic increase in apoB particles, which we obviously don‚Äôt want. Monounsaturated fats, found in high quantities in extra virgin olive oil, macadamia nuts, and avocados (among other foods), do not have this effect... The point is not necessarily to limit fat overall but to shift to fats that promote a better lipid profile‚Ä¶ But for many patients... lowering apoB‚Ä¶ cannot be accomplished with diet alone... Statins are far and away the most prescribed class of drugs for lipid management... statins‚Ä¶ are very helpful drugs for reducing apoB or LDL concentration in many patients... For people who can‚Äôt tolerate statins, I [prescribe] bempedoic acid (Nexletol),‚Äù Attia writes: ‚ÄúLike heart disease, cancer is a disease of aging. That is, it becomes exponentially more prevalent with each decade of life‚Ä¶ there were more cancer deaths among people between forty-five and sixty-four than from heart disease‚Ä¶ The problem we face is that once cancer is established, we lack highly effective treatments for it. Our toolbox is limited‚Ä¶ surgery is of limited value when cancer has metastasized, or spread. Metastatic cancers can be slowed by chemotherapy, but they virtually always come back‚Ä¶ Cancer cells‚Ä¶ stop listening to the body‚Äôs signals that tell them when to grow and when to stop growing‚Ä¶ a gene called PTEN, which normally stops cells from growing or dividing (and eventually becoming tumors), is often mutated or ‚Äúlost‚Äù in people with cancer, including about 31 percent of men with prostate cancer and 70 percent of men with advanced prostate cancer. Such ‚Äútumor suppressor‚Äù genes are critically important to our understanding of the disease‚Ä¶ not only is breast cancer genetically distinct from colon cancer (as the researchers expected), but no two breast cancer tumors are very much alike‚Ä¶ With a few exceptions‚Ä¶ solid organ tumors typically kill you only when they spread to other organs‚Ä¶ Prostate cancer kills only when it becomes metastatic‚Ä¶ Once cancer has spread, the entire game changes‚Ä¶ excess weight is a leading risk factor for both cancer cases and deaths, second only to smoking‚Ä¶ Obesity itself is strongly associated with thirteen different types of cancers‚Ä¶ [For] colorectal cancer (CRC)‚Ä¶ About 70 percent of people who are diagnosed with CRC before the age of fifty have no family history or hereditary conditions linked to the disease‚Ä¶ Of all the Horsemen, cancer is probably the hardest to prevent‚Äù Attia writes: ‚ÄúIn the [US], about 6 million people are diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease‚Ä¶ 1 million have been diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs... Exercise is the only intervention shown to delay the progression of Parkinson‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Having type 2 diabetes doubles or triples your risk of developing Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, about the same as having one copy of the APOE e4 gene‚Ä¶ APOE e4‚Ä¶ seems to accelerate other risk factors and driver mechanisms for Alzheimer‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Curiously, APOE e4 was not always a bad actor‚Ä¶ The e3 mutation showed up about 225,000 years ago, while e2 is a relative latecomer, arriving only in the last 10,000 years‚Ä¶ In environments where infectious disease was a leading cause of death, APOE e4 carriers may have been the lucky ones, in terms of longevity‚Ä¶ The single most powerful item in our preventive tool kit is exercise‚Ä¶ Strength training is likely just as important‚Ä¶ I now tell patients that exercise is‚Ä¶ the best tool we have in the neurodegeneration prevention tool kit‚Ä¶ Sleep is also a very powerful tool against Alzheimer‚Äôs disease... Sleep disruptions and poor sleep are potential drivers of increased risk of dementia‚Ä¶ There is a growing body of research linking oral health‚Ä¶ with overall health‚Ä¶ The conundrum we face is that our environment has changed dramatically over the last century or two, in almost every imaginable way‚Äîour food supply and eating habits, our activity levels‚Ä¶ Our genes no longer match our environment. Thus, we must be cunning in our tactics‚Ä¶to‚Ä¶ thrive‚Äù Attia writes: ‚Äúexercise has the greatest power to determine how you will live out the rest of your life‚Ä¶ even a fairly minimal amount of exercise can lengthen your life by several years. It delays the onset of chronic diseases, pretty much across the board, but it is also amazingly effective at extending and improving healthspan‚Ä¶ So if you adopt only one new set of habits based on reading this book, it must be in the realm of exercise‚Ä¶‚Äù Attia writes: ‚Äúeach of us needs to be training for the Centenarian Decathlon‚Ä¶ [Decide on] the ten most important physical tasks you will want to be able to do for the rest of‚Ä¶ your life‚Ä¶ [Consider a] long list of physical tasks that might include some of the following: Get up off the floor under your own power‚Ä¶ Lift a twenty-pound suitcase into the overhead compartment of a plane‚Ä¶ [from say] more than fifty different items.... [then] select which of these tasks [you] want to be able to perform‚Ä¶ in [your] ninth‚Ä¶ decade. [then] come up with a list of ten‚Ä¶ to become a different sort of athlete altogether: an athlete of life‚Ä¶ I structure my training around exercises that improve the following‚Ä¶ Grip strength‚Ä¶ to be able to lift the weight up and put it back down, slowly and with control‚Ä¶ Pulling motions‚Ä¶ Hip-hinging movements... I focus on these four foundational elements of strength because they are the most relevant to our Centenarian Decathlon‚Ä¶ studies suggest that grip strength‚Äîliterally‚Ä¶ how hard you can squeeze something with one hand‚Äîpredicts how long you are likely to live‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not about telling you what to eat; it‚Äôs about figuring‚Ä¶ out what works for your body and your goals‚Äîand, just as important, what you can stick to‚Ä¶‚ÄùAttia writes: ‚ÄúNutrition is relatively simple.... don‚Äôt eat too many calories, or too few; consume sufficient protein and essential fats; obtain the vitamins and‚Ä¶ minerals you need; and avoid pathogens‚Ä¶ Beyond that, we know relatively little with complete certainty. Read that sentence again, please‚Ä¶ a lot of the old clich√© expressions are probably right: If your great-grandmother would not recognize it, you‚Äôre probably better off not eating‚Ä¶ Plants are very good to eat. Animal protein is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to eat.

351,Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity,The Owners Manual We Should Have Received At Birth,DES,4,"When we are born, we aren't given an owner's manual. But now we have the book, ""Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity"" by Peter Attia, MD. It provides direction for how we can live a long and healthy life. But it also shares a prescription for the things we need to do if we want to live longer despite the diseases that are out to get us, including cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetesAttia is well known for his medical advice on his podcast and in other venues. This book cautions us about what he calls the ""four horsemen"" of diseases that are likely to kill us: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction. Despite limited progress in holding some of them back, Attia says modern medicine is still not very helpful until a disease is diagnosed before help is provided. ""Someone who drops dead of a heart attack did not just get sick an hour earlier,"" he writes. ""The disease was working inside them, silently and invisibly, for decades. Their internal defense mechanisms weakened as they grew older, and disease gained the upper hand. ""Among the key takeaways from the book:‚Ä¢ Current medicine relies on two tactics: procedures (e.g., surgery) and medications. But he suggests that future medicine should focus on five domains: exercise, nutrition, sleep, emotional health, and exogenous molecules, meaning drugs, hormones, or supplements.‚Ä¢ According to research by Thomas Perls of Boston University and his colleagues, who run the New England Centenarian Study, one in five people in the general population will have received some type of cancer diagnosis by age seventy-two. Similarly, one-quarter of the general population will have been diagnosed with clinically apparent cardiovascular disease by age seventy-five; among centenarians, that prevalence is reached only at age ninety-two.‚Ä¢ When centenarians die, they have generally (though not always) been sick or disabled for a much shorter period than people who died two or three decades earlier.‚Ä¢ According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), more than 40 percent of the US population is obese (defined as having a BMI[*2] greater than 30), while roughly another third is overweight (BMI of 25 to 30). Statistically, being obese means someone is at greater risk of chronic disease, so a lot of attention is focused on the ""obesity problem,"" but I take a broader view: obesity is merely one symptom of an underlying metabolic derangement, such as hyperinsulinemia, that also happens to cause us to gain weight.‚Ä¢ Doctors should focus on metabolical obesity defined in terms of the following five criteria: high blood pressure (>130/85), high triglycerides (>150 mg/dL), low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL in men or <50 mg/dL in women) central adiposity (waist circumference >40 inches in men or >35 in women) elevated fasting glucose (>110 mg/dL)‚Ä¢ If you meet three or more of these criteria, you have the metabolic syndrome‚Äîalong with as many as 120 million other Americans, according to a 2020 article in JAMA. About 90 percent of the US population ticks at least one of these boxes.‚Ä¢ Metabolism is how we take nutrients and break them down for use in the body. Those nutrients are processed and sent to their proper destinations in someone who is metabolically healthy. But when someone is metabolically unhealthy, many calories they consume end up where they are not needed, at best‚Äîor outright harmful, at worst.‚Ä¢ Fat also begins to infiltrate your abdomen, accumulating in between your organs.‚Ä¢ Patients with diabetes have a much greater risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and other dementias; one could argue that diabetes with related metabolic dysfunction is one thing that all these conditions have in common. ""This is why I place such emphasis on metabolic health and why I have long been concerned about the epidemic of metabolic disease not only in the United States but worldwide.""‚Ä¢ Humans have a unique capacity for turning calories from fructose into fat. Lots of people like to demonize fructose, especially in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, without really understanding why it's supposed to be so harmful. The story is complicated but fascinating. The critical factor here is that fructose is metabolized differently from other sugars. When we metabolize fructose, along with certain different types of foods, it produces large amounts of uric acid, best known as a cause of gout but also associated with elevated blood pressure.‚Ä¢ Cholesterol is essential to life. It is required to produce some of the most critical structures in the body, including cell membranes; hormones such as testosterone, progesterone, estrogen, and cortisol; and bile acids, which are necessary for digesting food.‚Ä¢ The humble egg, in particular, was singled out in a 1968 proclamation by the American Heart Association, accused of causing heart disease because of its high cholesterol content. It has remained in nutritional purgatory for decades, even after reams of research papers showing that dietary cholesterol (and particularly egg consumption) may not have much to do with heart disease at all. Eating lots of saturated fat can increase levels of atherosclerosis-causing lipoproteins in blood, but most of the actual cholesterol that we consume in our food ends up being excreted out our backsides. The vast majority of the cholesterol in our circulation is actually produced by our own cells. Nevertheless, US dietary guidelines warned Americans away from consuming foods high in cholesterol for decades, and nutrition labels still inform American consumers about how much cholesterol is contained in each serving of packaged foods.‚Ä¢ cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, right behind heart disease. Together, these two conditions account for almost one in every two American deaths. The difference is that we understand the genesis and progression of heart disease fairly well, and we have some effective tools with which to prevent and treat it. As a result, mortality rates from cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease have dropped by two-thirds since the middle of the twentieth century. But cancer still kills Americans at almost exactly the same rate as it did fifty years ago. We have made some progress against a few specific cancers, notably leukemia (especially childhood leukemia, as I noted earlier). For adults with leukemia, ten-year survival rates nearly doubled between 1975 and 2000, leaping from 23 percent to 44 percent. Survival rates for Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas have increased as well, especially the former. Yet these represent relatively small victories in a ""war"" that has not gone particularly well.‚Ä¢ The problem we face is that once cancer is established, we lack highly effective treatments for it. Our toolbox is limited. Many (though not all) solid tumors can be removed surgically, a tactic that dates back to ancient Egypt. Combining surgery and radiation therapy is pretty effective against most local, solid-tumor cancers. But while we've gotten fairly good at this approach, we have essentially maxed out our ability to treat cancers this way. We are not getting any more juice from the squeeze.‚Ä¢ I advocate early, aggressive, and broad screening for my patients‚Äîsuch as colonoscopy (or other colorectal cancer screening) at age forty, as opposed to the standard recommendation of forty-five or fifty‚Äîbecause the evidence is overwhelming that it's much easier to deal with most cancers in their early stages. I am also cautiously optimistic about pairing these tried-and-true staples of cancer screening with emerging methods, such as ""liquid biopsies,"" which can detect trace amounts of cancer-cell DNA via a simple blood test.‚Ä¢ Five decades into the war on cancer, it seems clear that no single ""cure"" is likely to be forthcoming. Rather, our best hope likely lies in figuring out better ways to attack cancer on all three of these fronts: prevention, more targeted and effective treatments, and comprehensive and accurate early detection.‚Ä¢ But what causes cancer to spread? We don't really know, and we are unlikely to find out anytime soon because only about 5 to 8 percent of US cancer research funding goes to the study of metastasis. Our ability to detect cancer metastasis is also very poor, although I do believe we are on the verge of some key breakthroughs in cancer screening,‚Ä¢ Right now, this usually means chemotherapy. Contrary to popular belief, killing cancer cells is actually pretty easy. Traditional chemotherapy occupies a fuzzy region between poison and medicine.‚Ä¢ Globally, about 12 to 13 percent of all cancer cases are thought to be attributable to obesity. Obesity itself is strongly associated with thirteen different types of cancers, including pancreatic, esophageal, renal, ovarian, and breast cancers, as well as multiple myeloma (see figure 7). Type 2 diabetes also increases the risk of certain cancers, by as much as double in some cases.‚Ä¢ If the first rule of cancer is ""Don't get cancer,"" the second rule is ""Catch it as soon as possible.""‚Ä¢ Alzheimer's disease is perhaps the most difficult, most intractable of the Horsemen diseases. We have a much more limited understanding of how and why it begins, and how to slow or prevent it, than we do with atherosclerosis.‚Ä¢ While female Alzheimer's patients outnumber men by two to one, the reverse holds true for Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's, both of which are twice as prevalent in men. Yet Parkinson's also appears to progress more rapidly in women than in men, for reasons that are not clear.Finally, the author suggests how medicine needs to change it focus:‚Ä¢ The first is exercise, which I consider to be by far the most potent domain in terms of its impact on both lifespan and health span.‚Ä¢ Next is diet or nutrition‚Äîor as I prefer to call it, nutritional biochemistry.‚Ä¢ The third domain is sleep, which has gone underappreciated by Medicine 2.0 until relatively recently.‚Ä¢ The fourth domain encompasses a set of tools and techniques to manage and improve emotional health.‚Ä¢ Our fifth and final domain consists of the various drugs, supplements, and hormones that doctors learn about in medical school and beyond.",TRUE,13-06-2023,"Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2023",593236599

It's even harder to find one who understands the importance of emotional health when it comes to living a fulfilling life. Peter Attia is that author.The book begins by helping the reader understand the causes beyond ""The Four Horsemen,"" and he doesn't simply chalk it up to just genetics. He helps you understand, with sound science and evidence, just what behaviors may be leading you down the path to sickness. He discusses genetics, and their impact as well. And most importantly, he helps the reader understand behaviors that may lead to an early grave.But rather than leaving you in doom and gloom, Dr. Attia paints an optimistic (and refreshingly clear) picture of what behavioral practices to engage in to stave off these dreaded diseases. They include everything from grip strength exercises and stability training, to diet recommendations, and even sleep (think it's too elementary? How have your afternoons been...droggy?)If you're serious about your health, and want to increase your HEALTHSPAN along with your lifespan, this book is for you.Find it on Amazon.

353,Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity,Risky if you take much of it literally.,T. French,4,"Allowing common sense (with supplementary googling of issues that are mentioned) to be your guide, there is some value in the book. The author seems to endorse some unqualified views that I would not take literally. If, for instance, you take his exercise endorsements literally, you are apt to damage your joints. If you consume the ""recommended"" amounts of protein for older people, you may retain more lean muscle mass, but you also are consuming an abundance of amino acids that promote growth - - and possibly the growth of cancer cells.As an example of a bizarre exercise recommendation, the author endorses the view that, when rucking, your rucksack contents should ideally be half of your own body weight. Orthopedic websites say that it should not exceed 10% of your body weight. Again, good luck to your joints if you follow this man's advice literally.There is a sense that the author is rather too ""wound up"": He recommends taking a camera and tripod along with you to the gym and filming yourself as you exercise in order to improve. He recommends doing this EVERY DAY. Yes, you actually lug a tripod and camera with you to a gym, every day of your life and film yourself to improve your manner of exercising.Unless you are a medical student, you can safely skip over the numerous paragraphs of detailed physiological process that he describes. Some of the terms that he uses again much later in the book are not defined, as if he assumes the reader has memorized their definitions early on. His intensity evidently carries him away with such blurs of arcane information.The last ""confessional"" chapter adds nothing to the book and, if anything removes whatever credibility the author had built up to that point - - and I suspect that this ""confession"" was included in order to please his family, as if there were no other way of doing that. If I were his editor I'd advise him to drop it in any further printings.Here's what I take from the book:The number one influencer on longevity is exercise. But if you exercise while defying orthopedic injuries (tendons, joints, etc.) you won't be able to exercise at all.If you're older, the author endorses the view that your protein intake should be approximately double that of the traditional recommendations. (This ""double"" recommendation occurs on various medical websites as well, if I remember). That's apparently because older people ""process"" protein less efficiently and because protein helps retain/build lean muscle mass. That, at least, is what I remember reading. BUT there are a number of studies that indicate that higher protein intake of animal-dairy point to a higher incidence of heart disease. Plant protein (I don't know the rate of consumption) seems to be associated with a lower rate of CVD. And high protein intake is not advisable if you have kidney disease. And there is no evidence that higher protein intake will help repair tendons, ligaments/joints. Nor will collagen. And then there are the ""growth"" amino acids that you're consuming in that protein that are associated with disease. So the whole ""higher protein"" recommendation remains vague except for the possibility of helping to heal muscle injuries and for the elderly, to retain lean muscle mass and possibly prevent falls.I look forward to the author's next volume on this subject where he will doubtless revise much of what he's said in a less intense fashion.",TRUE,13-08-2023,"Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2023",593236599

I highly recommend checking out the works of Greg Lehman, Peter O‚ÄôSullivan, or Todd Hargrove (he has some great books on these topics!). Many roads to Rome, and often the thing that modulates symptoms is not modulating them because of the story told by the guru. ‚ÄúThe outcome of the intervention does not justify the theory for why the intervention worked.‚Äù You don‚Äôt need DNS and you don‚Äôt need PRI, you likely need load/stressor management, variability, and mindful movement.Other than that, the rest of the book seems deeply thoughtful and science informed.",TRUE,11-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2023",593236599
355,Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity,Best book on health!,Beguiled By Books,5,"Favorite Quote: Perhaps my biggest takeaway was that modern medicine does not really have a handle on when and how to treat the chronic diseases of aging that will likely kill most of us.Synopsis: Outlive by Dr. Peter Attia is one of the best books on health and wellness I‚Äôve ever read. Attia‚Äôs principle goal is to show readers that we are on a precipice: continue on our path as we have in the last 50 years and, as a whole, suffer more from cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and neurodegenerative disease, or move past treating symptoms once they‚Äôve arrived and focus on preventative measures to help us age without these diseases.Bold premise? Yes. Accomplished? Also, yes.Over the course of 4oo pages, Attia details what we face as we get older: The Four Horsemen - perhaps not the four horsemen of the apocalypse from lore, but the new Four Horsemen of the Health Apocalypse. As cancer rates rise, so too, do cases of neurodegenerative diseases (like Alzheimer‚Äôs), Type 2 Diabetes (and other metabolic dysfunctions), and heart disease. The problem, Attia presents, is that these diseases are not acute - meaning that they take decades to develop. While someone may have a sudden heart attack, the mechanisms to create the environment that caused the heart attack have been brewing for years.This is where Attia pushes for the move from Medicine 2.0 to Medicine 3.0. Currently, we are living primarily in the world of Medicine 2.0 - treating symptoms and focusing on the present, not what our health could look like in 10, 20, or 30 years. Medicine 3.0, however, should begin as soon as we become aware of it - or sooner. Medicine 3.0 wants humans to avoid the Four Horsemen by using exercise, nutritional biochemistry (not diet - he discusses why in the book), and emotional well-being to set us up for living to age 100 and beyond.Why does this book beguile? Written by a doctor, Outlive by Peter Attia, pushes the boundaries of what‚Äôs typically acceptable in medicine today. He acknowledges how challenging it may be to get a DEXA scan from your doctor, and shares why you aren‚Äôt receiving proper nutritional advice from your primary provider. Attia hits on so many things in the medical system today that frustrate me: poor tracking of health metrics, treating symptoms and not causes, little to no specialized nutritional advice, and a pill-for-everything instead of viewing a patient holistically.Until the medical system, and more importantly, the medical insurance system catches up to Medicine 3.0 (which is probably less profitable than Medicine 2.0), those interested in longevity and preventative measures, may live in the nebulous realm of what I call, Medicine 2.75. Medicine 2.75 is where the patient, like you and me, must take our health into our own hands. Using tools like Everly Well and Empowered DX Labs, you can purchase your own at-home testing kits to monitor what‚Äôs important to you. You may have to find a more forward-thinking primary care provider to help order the right tests and scans and then take your nutrition into your own hands. It‚Äôs quite a bit of work for the average person, but well worth it to live long and enjoyable lives.",TRUE,11-07-2023,"Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2023",593236599
356,Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity,Medicine 3.0 is coming and Peter Attia leads the charge,Thomas Kelso,5,"This book is fantastic. Anyone with an interest in learning how to live a healthier, longer life should buy a copy and study it. That‚Äôs what I did. After reading it I ordered a second copy and gave it to my primary care physician because I wanted him to know where I was coming from in terms of being a patient and how I want to live my life. Outlive, is a goldmine of healthcare information.I became aware of Peter Attia about five years ago when a friend suggested I listen to an episode of The Drive. For those who are unfamiliar with Attia, this is his weekly podcast. After listening to it I was hooked and immediately became a subscriber and began listening to archived episodes. I spend a lot of time commuting and to date I‚Äôve probably listened to two-thirds of the interviews and the Ask Me Anything discussions. So when I received the notification that his long-awaited book was finally going to be published I preordered my copy. Once it arrived I got out my pen and highlighter and went to work.I believe I can speak from a position of strength when it comes to commenting on this book. I have walked a similar career path. Like Attia, I‚Äôve been trained in basic science research. I earned a PhD under the mentorship of the great Philip Gollnick, PhD, one of the pioneers of modern exercise science. Similar to Attia, I‚Äôve also been trained in medicine and surgery having completed a medical degree and a surgical residency in orthopedics.Attia is a voice in the wilderness shouting the message of Medicine 3.0, a philosophy based on the guiding principles of preventing the onset of chronic disease. He defines the time from birth to the onset of chronic disease as healthspan. The period of time from birth to death is lifespan. The goal of Medicine 3.0 is to increase healthspan so that it encompasses most, if not all, of lifespan. Medicine 3.0 is proactive whereas Medicine 2.0 (where we are now) is reactive. Medicine 2.0 begins treatment of an illness or disease only after it has been diagnosed, after the damage has begun. Medicine 3.0 is based on preventing, or delaying, the onset of disease or illness so that treatment is avoided.How does Attia recommend we go about maximizing healthspan? He believes this can be accomplished by focusing on doing everything possible to prevent what he terms, the four horsemen: metabolic syndrome (type-2 diabetes), cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs, etc.). The book is broken up into sections devoted to each of the horsemen. A final section, where Attia opens up and presents some of his personal journey, is devoted to emotional health. The importance of this section cannot be overstated. Emotional health probably should be considered the fifth horseman (but that would wreck the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse metaphor).He focuses on ways to prevent cognitive decline, the slowing of our mental processing speed as we age. An emphasis is placed on exercise, aerobic and strength training, as an intervention. Exercise increases cardiovascular and respiratory function and decreases the loss of muscle size and strength. It also increases bone density and deceases osteopenia and osteoporosis. In short, regular exercise reduces frailty. As frailty increases our risk of mortality increases. He makes the claim that the single most important thing anyone can do to improve healthspan is to exercise on a regular basis. It is better than any drug you can take (with the possible exception of rapamycin), nutrient, or diet.Attia and his co-author Bill Gifford tone down the technical aspects of some of the medical topics to make it more accessible to a lay audience. However, this does not detract from the quality of the information. If anything it makes the book better by reaching a broader audience. If a reader wants more detailed information on a topic they can easily obtain it by culling through the archives of The Drive where in depth interviews with preeminent physicians and scientists are available. He employs a team of highly skilled analysts that are constantly reading the latest scientific publications looking for high-quality research pertinent to his mission. He is at the forefront of Medicine 3.0.If you want to learn more about your physical and emotional health with the goal of living better and longer then read Outlive, the Science & Art of Longevity.",TRUE,22-04-2023,"Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2023",593236599

358,Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity,Attia does nothing half-way: amazing!,Latif Hamed,5,"I normally don‚Äôt write product reviews but after I read the few one- and two-star reviews describing the book as fluff I could not control my fingers! What?? Are you kidding me? To paraphrase senator Lloyd Bentsen, I know ‚Äúfluff‚Äù and my friends this book is no fluff. Rather, to say that this amazing book is by far and away at the top of its genre is an understatement. I write this as I embark on a second reading of ‚ÄúOutlive‚Äù, having read it once almost in one setting, skipping a couple of exercise sessions no less. Attia clearly possesses the intellect, integrity, wit, vigor, candor, and God knows what else that went into the making of this amazing mind and person. Everyone will experience the book from his special angle, based on background and knowledge, but no one will leave empty handed. As an eye surgeon, professor, and author of several books myself, I can say that I so thoroughly enjoyed this book and will be sharing it with my friends and family and recommending it to patients and colleagues. Attia‚Äôs content is a favorite discussion topic with my children: podcast, emails, and finally the book, and sometimes my son or daughter would wonder aloud ‚Äúwhat do you think is Attia‚Äôs position on this?‚Äù.So what if I, as a moslem, will be ‚Äúadding‚Äù a final chapter to the book, so as to discuss it within my circle, that imparts a transcendental framework to our quest for a long life beyond the raising of a strong healthy physical horse. If you believe that your existence totally ends with death, it makes perfect sense to embark on a quest to lengthen your life, beyond which there is nothing. But if you belief as I do that there is an eternal component to our essence that continues beyond the entombment of our bodies, then your horizon and end point is limitless. Is the martyr who died defending his people and his family against oppression and tyranny at age 20, achieving a dismal Attia-style longevity, a loser, a tragic figure who fell victim to unfortunate conflicts, or is he worth a thousand longevity-focused horses? To exclusively pamper the animal (body) and ignore the horseman (soul) is to put the cart before the horse. In addition, to preach that we should persevere in trying to lengthen life a few more years, and spend a whole lifetime doing it, strikes me as wasting your life in order to lengthen it.My advice to friends and family is this: Go ahead and double click on exercise and nutrition; huff and buff to raise your VO2 max, and be stable with firm resolve as you prioritize DNS. But do bear in mind that you are making the horse strong to serve the horseman, and not the other way around. We are not mere shells: eat, move, sleep, copulate, repeat. Get yourself a more spacious framework. Be in control as your phosphorylated spirit commandeer the horse so that the both of you can stand, marsh, live, and die with nobility and honor. ‚ÄúOutliving‚Äù to me is a transcendent term, to outdo and go beyond the bounds of your biological carbon-based body, to achieve escape velocity through a noble righteous life on Earth that propels your soul to heaven when biology fails you, so as to justify the reason that God commanded the angels to bow to Adam.Of course, this is not a book about religion, and of course we agree less on religion than we do nutrition, and of course moslems are a zealot punch (attempt at self-deprecating humor), and of course as a physician I would love to read the 2000 page version (sorry, Penguin Random House). But from my perspective this is a beautifully written book by an author that I and my kids grew to love and admire, one who does not do anything half-way.

361,Hundred Years' War on Palestine,The History is Important to Understanding Today,Ralph Lehman,5,"The horrific Hamas attack on the Israelis and the planned attack on Gaza by Israel is best understood by looking at the history of the creation of Israel and the resulting displacement and disregard of the Palestinians living there. This is a well-written and even-handed description of that history. The land, possessions and rights of the Palestinians were taken away by Israel with the help of Britain, the Arab states, and the United States. Israel's disregard of the lives of civilians in many instances, with the help and involvement of the United States, especially Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig, are as awful as the actions Hamas if we believe that all people are equal and all civilians should be protected. The United States has never been, and is not now, a neutral party that seeks peace. Unfortunately, the term ""anti-semitic"" is used against those that simply want the Palestinians to have a voice. A true two-state solution with an independent and free Palestinian state, and the recognition of Israel's right to exist is the only solution. This book should be read by all who have grown up with a one-sided view of the Israeli -Palestinian issues.",TRUE,23-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2023",1250787653

Some disingenuous reviews claim they didn't know anything about the conflict and it's somehow bad/ biased. There will be more. Instead, it's a careful study that engages with the ideas of settler colonialism in Palestine and lays out the case carefully and uses his own family history to anchor what he argues.Whether you agree with the conclusions, is your own choice. But, it's a careful walk through history done well and uses his family as a frame.

367,Hundred Years' War on Palestine,"A good, comprehensive summary",A H Kobayashi,3,"This short book is rather ambitious in the sense that it sums up the history of the conflicts in Israel/Palestine in just over 250 pages. So inevitably, Khalidi left out certain details. His assessment of the history of the conflict is in a way predictable, as he portrays Zionism as nothing but a colonial movement and he blames Britain and then the US for propping up Israel as if it had been a victim of persecution by the Arabs. There are some puzzling omissions, as he does not talk much about the real motives of the Arab nations in the wake of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The Hashemite kingdom‚Äôs role in early Jewish immigration cannot be ignored in this history, but he does not touch this thorny issue. The big surprise is the almost total omission of the Yom Kippur War. Although Khalidi did experience Israeli violence in Lebanon personally, he doesn‚Äôt sound like someone in close touch with the people actually there, especially in Gaza. That is indeed the problem of the PLO or the Fatah, by his own admission, that they were out of touch. As I always got an impression that they were playing a cynical power game, by deliberating placing the Palestinians in harms way so that they could counter the Israeli narrative of national victimhood. But Khalidi, though admitting this problem, does not explore the politics of the PLO leadership deeply enough. Hamas needs to be examined more in detail, but perhaps he is not so well informed? At least, this book serves as a good summary of the conflict from a Palestinian perspective, though personally, I would like to hear the voices of those who actually live in Gaza or the West Bank. Undoubtedly, the best part of the book is the final chapter, in which he explains how US policy worked and how the Palestinians have consistently failed to influence the US (i.e., they were always outwitted and outsmarted by the Israelis). He almost sounds more like a liberal American than a Palestinian. His proposed course of action for the Palestinian leaders are sound, but also too academic, which would be difficult to implement, unfortunately.",TRUE,27-05-2021,"Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2021",1250787653

I was not aware of the indigenous Palestinian inept organizing and inept leadership during the five decades of the groundwork that created the modern State of Israel. This ineptitude continues today as Fatah and Hamas are unable to work together for the betterment of the Palestinian people.Even with inept Palestinian leadership, world opinion has tilted to support for the underdog Palestinian people..Professor Khalidi does not present a solution to the conflict.... Other than to pose and awaken that the 8 million Jews and 4 million Palestinians need to embrace the today reality that neither group is going away.

There are 14 scenes to find a handful of images. Each scene is a location familiar to Bluey fans but would be enjoyable for a child who hasn't seen the show as well. The pages are a thicker quality so we treat this activity book like a book and keep it on the book shelf for continual use. Since each scene only has 8-12 items to find there's no need to cross out or circle the hidden object. It's easy enough to keep track of what you have found and what still needs to be found. This also allows the book to be shared between children or played with over and over if nothing is marked on the pages.

I have a disability and it has been my belief that so many people miss the great things I can bring to the table. Ultimately, by finding the value in everyone, we all get better.The challenge I had was with the study that talked about high school students and where they would be 10 years later. Struggle can happen at any point in someone's life (including as a sophomore or junior in high school). As I read this section, I caught myself wondering if those later struggles were brought into consideration.

Too often we become frustrated when we fail to learn something new easily or when our progress seems stymied. Yet that is part of the natural process of learning.I also like how he wrote about using your knowledge even if it is not yet perfect. Students learning a second language, for example, should be experimenting in the wild and getting corrected as much as possible. When I was learning Spanish in Costa Rica many years ago, I noticed the students who spent most of their time socializing outperformed those of us who dutifully did our homework each night.In short, this book is an inspiring, enjoyable, and worthwhile read.",TRUE,02-11-2023,"Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2023",593653149

This book is an encouraging review of concepts and examples that show how success can be built from varied and difficult circumstances. My only criticism is that section two - creating structures to sustain motivation and momentum - falls short in consideration of the various starting points (beyond social and cultural circumstances) that change how individuals will be positioned in better or worse ways on their journey. There is a hope here to start with a level of academic rigor that few popular books attain, and then build on those with reflections and interpretations. That is refreshing and admirable to be sure, but misses one important issue: the means for ranking and rating studies and other research suffer from some of the same limitations as the selection processes he highlights in part 3. I don‚Äôt mean this to be a harsh criticism, as Grant shows both commitment and passion that are beyond the vast majority of authors.

And add in CHRISTMAS!!? I'm a goner. And I just adored this lovable story. Enemies to lovers, forced collaboration, and so much adorable banter and sexual tension. Cat and Noah are delightful together. The dialogue is witty and clever, the whole fixer upper premise is loads of fun and so unique, and the emotional layers just keep unravelling for a really beautiful story underneath all the fire and sass. Cat is a heroine you root for, and Noah is the character you FALL for. Their relationship (and Noah's backstory) had me ALL in my feels. Lucy always weaves emotional complexity so effortlessly into her stories, and this one had me ALL up in my feelings. And the spice! These two are electric together- the push-pull between them was epic. Not to mention we had a great dose of Christmas running throughout.

455,The Christmas Fix,The mamma jamma of all Christmas romances! Cat King is amazing!,NovelMomma,5,"If you‚Äôve read Mr. Fixer Upper (and if you haven‚Äôt, what on earth are you waiting for?!?!), you probably already love Cat King. I know I did. As soon as I finished Mr. Fixer Upper, I had a list of characters I was hoping for more from. Cat was at the top. She was so full of life. She worked hard and played just as hard. She stood up for what she believed in. She was a great friend and loved her family dearly. How much more could you ask for in a character? I loved Cat King.So, Lucy Score is fantastic. She heard the outcry of her fans and the whispers (okay, it‚Äôs Cat...they were probably shouts) from Cat, and The Christmas Fix was born. Okay, I‚Äôm not positive exactly how this happened, but this is how I like to imagine it. Either way, Lucy gave us The Christmas Fix, an amazing enemies-to-lovers Christmas story, and it is perfect. I thought I loved Cat King before, but now I am completely enamored. I am in awe of this woman. Everything I liked about her before is magnified by a million, but there is also this other side to her that we didn‚Äôt get to see in Mr. Fixer Upper. This side that loves so hard, cares so deeply, and turns to mush only at the most perfect of moments. She is a complete and total rockstar. She still stands up for women‚Äôs rights, works herself harder than anyone else, and enjoys having a good time, but watching her fall in love is truly something special.And Noah, oh Noah. Noah may seem like a complete jerk in the beginning (remember, this is enemies-to-lovers, and I already loved Cat), but there is just something about him. He is so noble. Even when he is completely wrong, he has good intentions. He is a good, sensible guy who loves his daughter and his town. He wants to protect both from anything that could harm them. Unfortunately, he believes Cat King falls into that category. However, Cat being Cat is determined to prove him wrong. As the story unfolds, you fall further and further in love with Noah.I absolutely love these two together. The balance they found with one another was incredible. Noah needs Cat to bring him out of his shell and really live. He needs her to show him what fun really is. And Noah is the stability and steadfast support Cat needs in her crazy life. And the chemistry, oh my goodness the chemistry. These two are completely off the charts. Their banter is fantastic. Cat says what she thinks and doesn‚Äôt hold back which causes (and/or ends) some fantastic arguments. And their love is even more explosive than their hate. While you have to wait for them to get there, it is completely worth it! The tension builds until it boils over in perfection.What more could you want, right? Well, in true Lucy Score fashion, this book brings all the feels. The town of Merry really becomes a character of its own with the wonderful people and traditions it holds dear. Watching the town come together in this time of need is amazing. The residents are unique and wonderful. The way they support one another is heartwarming. The way they take in Cat and her crew is extraordinary. I seriously want to move there...who wouldn‚Äôt?This book was beautifully written. The symbolism is subtle and truly amazing, the characters are so real and complex, and seriously all the feels are there without it being over the top. There are very few authors that can include humor, love, witty banter, and so much emotion in the same book naturally, but this book truly has it all. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.What are you still doing here? Put your time to good use and one click now!

457,The Christmas Fix,Favorite Christmas book I re-read every year,Bookstagrambrielle,5,"I love this book. I read this book every year around the holidays. Lucy Score is one of the few authors I read that writes mostly in third person. I prefer reading first person, dual point of view, but the way Lucy writes, it doesn't bother me. The story is so good and so well written that I don't struggle to follow our feel confused.Noah is the manager of the small town of Merry, Connecticut. A town that was destroyed after a a bad storm, leaving property damage by wind and rain. He's up tight, needs to be in control of everything in his life and has earned the nickname, Mr. No. Cat is general contractor who stars in a home makeover TV show. She had done a home in Merry, so when the town was hit by that devastating storm, she felt the need to go back and help in any way she could. That led to her coming up with an idea to restore as much of the town as possible, while filming it for the show. This way, the town could get the help it needed and her show would also benefit in paid advertising and ratings. Noah was not receptive to this and fought her every step of the way. They butted heads until their arguing led to a heated make out session. Soon they were sneaking around together and learning that they both had the same agenda for the town. What started as hate, turned into lust and eventually turned into love. Knowing that Noah could never leave his home as he was co-parenting, Cat has to decide if she can figure out a way to be with Noah and possibly give up her lifestyle of moving around the country, rehabbing homes.This is such a great story and I absolutely love Noah and Cat. They are both such strong capable people, so different but so right for each other. This is a funny and steamy love story and as I mentioned above, I love it so much, that I re-read it every year.

530,Elon Musk,"If you want to grow an Elon Musk personality, skip standard life advice",Ethan,5,"One of the conclusions I reached early in my life is that there is a huge disconnect between so called ""conventional wisdom"" in most important areas of life and what actually works in real life as shown for example in the difference between being an A-list celebrity and ranking high in the Forbes' list of wealthiest individuals.Elon Musk's life, that Walter Isaacson documents in this book, is a prime example of this disconnect.If you go by standard advice about what it takes to get admitted into one of America's top schools, there is no way that in 2023 a white kid without connections who grew up in a somehow privileged background -upper middle class in segregated South Africa- who scores 1400 (V670, Q730) in the SAT in his second try would be offered admission at any of America's top universities. And yet, this what Elon Musk looked like on paper circa 1992 when he applied as transfer student to the University of Pennsylvania. Luckily for the United States, admission committees at America's top schools 30 years ago were more rational than their contemporary counterparts. Elon Musk gained admission to the University of Pennsylvania and the rest, as they say, is history.My path crossed with Elon Musk's at the Stanford seminar mentioned at the beginning of chapter 20 of the book. Back then I was a nervous young professional who had just submitted his application for graduate study at Stanford praying that I would get in. I recall two things distinctively from that talk: 1) Elon's telling that he had dropped out of Stanford to start his first company -I told myself that I would not be as silly if I got in-, 2) that he told the audience during the QA that he didn't think a particular degree or life experience prepared someone better than others to become a successful entrepreneur. Both ideas went against the standard advice I had heard from other speakers at the Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders seminar and, unimpressed, I didn't go to say hello to Elon Musk at the end of the talk. In the book I learn that it's in that seminar that Jeffrey Straubel approached Elon for an investment in Tesla.I have gone back many times in my mind to that October 2003 talk since Elon Musk began to be recognized for his genius in Silicon Valley circles (late 2000s, early 2010s).It is often said that a person's character is forged during a person's childhood and teen years. The biggest insight I am getting from Walter Isaacson's book is that Elon Musk's were the exact opposite of what experts in child and teen development say what those years should be like.I get that Elon Musk is a controversial personality with some. At the same time, the Western civilization needs more people like him if it wants to continue to be the leading civilization in the world both on the technological front as well as on the population front -his ideas on low birthrates being the biggest threat to civilization are right on the money.To summarize, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.I want thank both Elon Musk as well as Walter Isaacson for partnering to make it a reality. It's very rare in human history to have a chance to get such a detailed insight into the mind of one of the contemporary history making personalities.",TRUE,09-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 9, 2023",1982181281
531,Elon Musk,Rocket Man,David Shulman,5,"Every aerospace executive and board member should read Walter Isaacson‚Äôs biography of Elon Musk. Starting from scratch Musk has built America‚Äôs leading rocket and space communications company by ignoring the hidebound bureaucratic rules of the major aerospace companies delivering rockets at one tenth the cost of his bloated competitors. Musk‚Äôs rules are:1. Doubt every requirement.2. Question every cost?3. Act with a sense of urgency.4. Learn by failing.5. Improvise.The other secret that Musk applied to Tesla as well as SpaceX is that he integrated design, engineering, and manufacturing so that each of those entities can learn from the others. Thus, engineers and designers are able to make improvements in manufacturing as issues arise. Steve Jobs at Apple integrated design and engineering, but outsourced manufacturing to China.Rising from an unhappy childhood in South Africa, Musk became a Silicon Valley entrepreneur to become part of the famed ‚ÄúPayPal Mafia.‚Äù He used his PayPal success to fund Tesla and SpaceX and the rest is history.Musk‚Äôs genius has the ability to inspire loyalty, at least for a time, of a host brilliant people who built his empire. However, empathy is not his middle name, and, in many ways, he seems to be a very cruel person. He is one of those people who professes to love humanity, but really doesn‚Äôt like people as individuals.Isaacson discusses Musk‚Äôs chaotic personal life. Three marriages, 11 children two of whom by sperm donation. Isaacson doesn‚Äôt explain why so many of Musk‚Äôs children were conceived by in vitro fertilization.Then, of course there is Twitter, now called X after his favorite letter. His adventure at Twitter seems to be one giant ego trip where he promised to free that social media site from it ‚Äúwokeness.‚Äù To say the staff of Twitter was woke, would be an understatement. He wanted to encourage free expression, yet under his rule Twitter has become a cesspool of hate.I had my own run in with twitter. Despite all of Musk‚Äôs talk of a new openness I was banned for using the term ‚Äúcircular firing squad‚Äù to characterize Hunter Biden bringing his father into his legal thicket. Something is really wrong with X and from press accounts is seems to be getting worse by the day.Despite being hagiographic at times, Isaacson brings to life one of our leading entrepreneurs who is bringing us into new electric and space ages.",TRUE,14-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2023",1982181281
532,Elon Musk,Isaacson's best - a tour de force on three dimensions,Nilendu Misra,5,"This book is very likely Isaacson's best. One, he got almost unlimited access to Elon and team for two years. Two, Elon! Three, a fascinating case of embracing Risk-with-capital-R as not something to avoid (""do no harm""), not something to optimize (risk-reward analysis) but something to warmly embrace and overcome with will, ""surge"" and first-principle driven engineering.The book has essentially three broad parallel themes often intertwined in narratives -Relationship -- Family and friends - relationship and evolution of it with Elon's parents, grandparents of both sides, kids, spouses/SOs, siblings - especially Kimbal, cousins and a handful of business friends including some employees in both Tesla and SpaceX.Results -- Zip2/Paypal, EVs, SolarRoof, Rockets/NASA, Neuralink, Hyperloop, Twitter - workspaces where Elon ventured and revolutionized them.Regulating Principles - This is where Isaacson has done a masterful job. He observed, probed and eked out a set of rules that Elon follows - with himself, with how he gets work done, with other people.As someone who's worked (""hardcore""ly, if I may) in Tesla during famed ""Production Hell"" and was lucky to witness several of the events mentioned - e.g., 5000th car of the week, a black Model 3, coming out of factory on June 30, 2018 at 2 AM-ish - Isaacson's description of Tesla, and its mission-driven culture, is accurate, though as a genuine believer in that mission, seemed awfully short. Some of Elon's brilliant ""management emails"" deserved a mention - e.g., how not/to communicate (no abbreviations; hierarchy agnostic), how to/not meet (get out if you are adding no value), how to set goals (Hofstadder's law - set it so ambitious that even missing it by 50% would still get it done twice as fast had it not been set so) etc. Plus, Elon is always highly readable, and short.To bridge to standard practices of management, as it is followed in most western world today, the author follows up with most people after they had ""interesting pushbacks"" from Elon, mostly when they either did not have an answer and did not say they did not know, or when - simply - Elon was thinking far ahead of them, and thinking multi-threaded to not offer much of ""contextual relevance"". The emphasis on ""small teams with right individuals will always outcompete large teams"" is spot on and is essentially why Autopilot is successful with 150 engineers and Twitter was awfully slow moving with few thousands.Last third of the book was often observed and written in first person. The author was present in many of those events. But that takes a little bit away from the velocity of the book and perhaps adds 50-60 more pages that merely repeat the themes already established, with apt narratives, earlier in the book. Moving Twitter's 5000 servers from Sacramento data center to Portland - first thought to take months till Elon diverted his jet, landed in Sacramento, opened an air vent with a (borrowed) utility knife, went underneath the rack and essentially did a ""POC"" - is one such example. It was an intersting read, especially for an engineer, irrespective.No single individual in last 100 years, perhaps, did change things more for ""humanity as a macro"". ""Elon Musk"" is the best way to understand him and is a brilliant, captivating read. The grand theme of the book, to me, was as Elon was quoted - ""This is how civilizations decline. They quit taking risks. And when they quit taking risks, their arteries harden. Every year there are more referees and fewer doers.""This is not just a book on Elon Musk. This is a book to look at risk with a fundamentally different world-, or should I say 'cosmic-', view.",TRUE,15-09-2023,"Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2023",1982181281
533,Elon Musk,An Expedition into the Genius of Elon Musk: A Review of Walter Isaacson‚Äôs Portrayal,*AT,5,"Walter Isaacson‚Äôs narrative on Elon Musk is nothing short of a masterful voyage through the labyrinth of one of the most iconic innovators of our age. The book is a meticulously crafted narrative, weaving the intricacies of Musk‚Äôs remarkable journey with a depth that leaves the reader both inspired and enlightened. It‚Äôs a comprehensive expedition into the life and mind of Elon Musk (EM), displaying an exquisite balance of awe-inspiring moments coupled with a grounded critique that keeps the narrative tethered to a realm of practicality.The section that notably stands out is the exploration into EM‚Äôs management mantras. The unraveling of 'The Algorithm,' a term synonymous with Musk‚Äôs methodical approach towards problem-solving, and the traits he values in his team - Excellence, Trust, and Discipline, are not merely discussed but dissected. This portion of the book is a well of insights for anyone eager to decode the enigmatic leadership style of EM.Isaacson, with his seasoned narrative prowess, doesn‚Äôt merely tell a story; he takes you on an intellectual expedition, unveiling layers of EM‚Äôs persona and managerial acumen. The critique embedded within the narrative ensures the reader doesn‚Äôt get lost in the glorification but stays grounded, appreciating the practical implications and the tangible takeaways from Musk‚Äôs journey.A unique charm of Isaacson‚Äôs writing is his ability to delve deep into the subject while maintaining a broader perspective. The wish for his next venture to contrast the geniuses he‚Äôs chronicled is palpable. One can only anticipate the richness such a narrative would entail, juxtaposing the different shades of brilliance that have shaped the modern technological epoch.In conclusion, this book isn‚Äôt just a biography; it‚Äôs a meticulously crafted lens through which one can appreciate the genius of Elon Musk, rendered with a level of finesse and understanding that is quintessentially Isaacson. It‚Äôs not just a read, but an experience, that leaves you with a profound understanding and a lingering curiosity for the boundless realm of innovation.",TRUE,14-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2023",1982181281
534,Elon Musk,A Great Man of History,Mark R. Whittington,5,"This is a fascinating biography that tells the warts and all story of one of the greatest men of the 21st Century. Elon Musk has emerged from a toxic and abusive childhood to becoming the richest man on the planet, having revolutionized space travel and reinvented the electric car. The book tells in detail about how he did those things, as well as delving into robotics, AI, neural implants to cure blindness and paralysis, and other things.The book also notes that Musk is far from a nice guy, lacking the ability to feel empathy and having a tendency to fly into rages as well as deep depression. The book does not exactly put its subject on the couch, but it does give an insight into what drives him.Musk personifies the Great Man Theory of History. The theory suggests that history is driven by great men (almost always men) who rise to power seemingly out of nowhere and drive people and nations to achieve great things. Just Imagine what our world would be like without Musk and one must conclude that, for all of his quirks and flaws, the world is lucky to have him in it.",TRUE,15-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2023",1982181281
535,Elon Musk,Approach this book Fearlessly,G.R.Egoville,5,"This is a brilliant attempt by Walter Isaacson to delve into what makes up this century's genius Elon Musk. Not an easy book about a one of a kind human being. Elon Musk has gone and will go where no one else has, so far. He is a contradiction on virtually every level ... difficult to like but impossible not to respect hence the top people in technology eagerly work for and with him. He says what he believes and cares not at all for the repercussions because it is his truth. His predictions for the future of the earth and mankind are impossible to ignore and the liars despise him for it.For his part, Isaacson has captured this controversial genius as succinctly as he did Steve Jobs. I finished this book as an Elon Musk fan and think others will also.Read this book to learn about America's possibilities going forward not to learn how to be a billionaire.",TRUE,27-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2023",1982181281
536,Elon Musk,"As complex as the man himself, but well told for the rest of us",Craig W.,5,"I don't think there is much doubt about Elon Musk being a genius - and genius' rarely fit well in the world the rest of us inhabit. Their thinking and drives simply don't work in a system based on getting along and establishing your place. A genius is constantly a square peg in a round hole - that is almost the definition of the term.However, we all want a look inside the mind of a genius. Walter Isaacson is the rare writer who can present a complex person in such a way that we want to read each and every word. By the end of the book we are both excited about what Musk can do and totally exhausted by the effort he requires of those around him.I venture to say none of us will agree with everything he does/says and we shouldn't worry about that. He will try anything and is willing to fail spectacularly. It is the only way he sees to get big things done. While I certainly agree with him about this, I wouldn't want to trade places.

I'd have loved to have had this helpful info when I was young and trying to learn to cook by myself. It was always a joy to surprise my mom with food on the table when she got home from work, even when just a grilled cheese sandwich (made in an old pie pan under the broiler) and a can of soup I'd opened and heated on the stove! The possibilities available in this book are a great beginning to open the imaginations of curious kids to tastes, textures, and the many rewards and confidence boost of good cooking!My only negative comment is the use of food processors and similar newer tools when a large bowl, a spoon or spatula, and some elbow grease worked fine as 'food processors' for centuries...insert eye roll here! Also, describing to the kids how to to separate an egg USING YOUR BARE HANDS was a completely new and approaching barbaric idea I had never heard of or even thought of doing, ick! When there are always two halves of eggshells to use from one to the other, why would anyone pour the raw egg in their hand to let all but the yolk then dribble through their fingers?? Aside from the convenient shells already in your hands, there's also an easy kitchen tool called an egg separater, yes really, that could have been shown among the kitchen tools. Much easier, less gross, and all around cleaner.

560,Tom Lake: A Reese's Book Club Pick,A Buddhist blend of Grovers Corners and northern Michigan,switterbug/Betsey Van Horn,5,"Appreciating the little things in life, the joy of day-to-day existence, and the love for your family and your work is what Tom Lake meant to me. Tom Lake refers to a (fictional) summer stock theater in northern Michigan in the 1980s, close to the locale of the current 2020 timeline--- a cherry farm (and pears, and apples). The late eighties marked a luminous period for protagonist/narrator Lara, a time that she walked the fine line between adulting and adulthood, coming of age amid a torrent of drama that swept her up in its fury. And then there was Our Town, the play within the novel that portrayed Lara‚Äôs life on the stage (and backstage).Lara is telling her three twenty-something daughters about her short stint as an actress in her twenties, and the brief romantic affair with Peter Duke, a famous movie star before he was a famous movie star. The gorgeous cherry farm backdrop is like a staid but vivid character, with Lara, husband Joe, and the three girls all together for the first time in a while. Due to the pandemic, they don‚Äôt have the usual crew to help pick the fruit, so the storytelling unfolds as the family works the orchard during harvest time. Like the cherries, some parts are sweet, some tart, and all of it is juicy.I felt the air, inhaled the scents, the cherries, the land and the whole layout of the farm while reading. And there is the kindness, too, of this family, whose flaws are also part of their strengths. The chaos of Lara‚Äôs life as a young woman is juxtaposed with the serenity of her life now, and the two timelines fluidly alternate, sometimes gently, at other times with piercing intensity. And every storyline has at least two. So, when you read about Lara in the past, or present, you just can‚Äôt help sniffing around to see the connections, of what surprise is crouched in the corner or hidden behind the door. I verily slipped into Lara‚Äôs character and imagined what decisions I would make as her, given so many pressing options and dilemmas.Ann Patchett nails it every time, her characters are complex and her graceful pace is measured even when events are brutal. Lara is a radiant work-in-progress during her young years, many readers will see themselves in her. I was a local stage actor in Austin during my twenties, so I immersed myself in Tom Lake, pretending to be Lara acting as Emily Gibbs and then back to Lara again. The two timelines showed the difference between the fiery summer love of youth and the deep, tender, and mature love of family that you helped to create. The high points were explosive, even when they were pin-drop quiet. Lara‚Äôs low points stirred me almost to tears; I could feel her pulse against mine.If you‚Äôve never seen a production or haven‚Äôt read Our Town, you‚Äôre about to get a spoiler‚Äôs worth in the novel. But I think Ms. Patchett has surmised that most of her readers are already familiar with Thornton Wilder‚Äôs play. She coalesced Our Town and Tom Lake together in a way that reveals her refined skill of integration. Tom Lake and Our Town were separate but conjoined. I know that doesn‚Äôt make sense, but it will when you read the book. She also quotes Chekhov at pique (and even peak) intervals; she shares the Russian writer‚Äôs work with spare but specific devotion.I recently learned that Patchett has never owned a smart phone, and doesn‚Äôt herself do social media (she talks to the camera and her staff completes the rest).

However, after 10 pages, then 25 pages, then 50, I was willing to close it and put in the little library box or pass it on to a neighbor. It just seemed so done before. The story was obvious and the characters were all meh. Everything seemed like it had been hashed over a million times a million times better.But, I kept reading because the neighbor I would have given it to had left for vacation. I figured I'd plod through (actually, if I weren't so willing to close it and pick up another book, it would have been a quick read) until the neighbor came home. So, of course, I read on. Mid way through, I was invested but still willing to close it and move on. Three quarters through, the characters became more human and interesting, and then I realized that the author wasn't reinventing the wheel but reinterpreting ""Our Town."" (Duh, she said, after being hit over the head with the sledge hammer of metaphor of the plot.)

562,Tom Lake: A Reese's Book Club Pick,A Book to Savor and Reflect On,Bonnie Brody,5,"Ann Patchett is one of my favorite writers and she has once again written a novel I love.The novel takes place at the beginning of the Covid epidemic. Lara, her husband, and her three young adult daughters are residing on the family orchard in Northern Michigan. The narrative is told from Lara's viewpoint and consists primarily of her daughters' wanting to know about her past life - especially her romantic involvement with the now famous actor, Peter Duke.Much of the story is about a summer stock stage production of 'Our Town' located in Michigan on Tom Lake. Lara is in her twenties and has been called upon to take the lead role after the original actress has decided to quit. On Lara's first day, she is greeted by a charismatic young man named Peter Duke. From their first meeting evolves a drawn-out romance and affair that leaves Lara much beholden to Peter's narcissistic view of himself. Lara is quite aware that her daughters want to know all the intimacies that she and Peter shared, but she is not ready to give out these details freely.It is understood that Lara once had a promising future in acting but she chose to give it up for what she considers her idyllic life as a mother and wife. Her daughters find this all hard to absorb and want to know every last bit about Laura's time with Peter and her involvement with the stage.The writing flows beautifully and the imagery is incandescent. I could see Lara and feel her emotions. Ann Patchett knows people and her empathic writing exudes from every page. There isn't one false note.I have never read Our Town but that didn't stop me from loving this novel, nor did it prevent me from understanding what was transpiring. I learned a lot about stage production, acting, and actors.I especially loved how the author provided each of her daughters with a distinct and inimitable personality, all beloved to her and each other. This is a book to savor and reflect on. It is as sweet as the smell of cherries in Lara's Michigan orchard.",TRUE,10-09-2023,"Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2023",006332752X

Neal,4,"Ann Patchett is a gifted writer and once again her unique ability to create characters within an engaging plot is well developed. The story revolves around Tom Lake, a community summer theatre production in Michigan. Patchett weaves a story told from the main character who aspires to be an actress but is conflicted with the reality of the demands within the acting profession. A side story includes the quaint setting of a cherry fruit farm and Patchett describes the scenery of the farm and daily life with flawless description. The novel is connected to the famous play, Our Town. Since I had not read the play for many, many years I was a little lost in the beginning. Rereading Our Town in advance might bring familiarity to the reader.

566,Tom Lake: A Reese's Book Club Pick,A fabulous story from one of America's great novelists,Bway Jack,5,"I love Ann Patchett, whose gifts as a storyteller are almost unmatched, as wide-ranging as her varying choice of subjects. TOM LAKE is another triumph- and not just because it centers around folks in the theatre. Although I'm sure that helped.Lara Kenison played Emily Webb in her high school production of OUR TOWN, as have so many young girls have in their past. But for Lara, it becomes a touchstone in her life. In college, she reprises the role, and a famous Hollywood agent happens to see her performance. The Tinseltown legend suddenly becomes real - flying to LA, screen tests, her first film role, commercials, even a TV series. Then, while waiting for the film's long-delayed release, she goes off to summer stock at Tom Lake in Wisconsin. There, she meets her first great love, a fire of ambition named Peter Duke.Years later, Lara unspools the story of her Hollywood adventure to her now-grown daughters, including some discrete details of her love affair with Duke, now a huge movie star. Lara and her husband Joe run a fruit farm in rural Michigan. The story of how she goes from the LA Dream Factory to the cherry orchard unfolds while she and her daughters pick the ripening fruit in the hot summer sun.There are twists and turns in every story, and Lara's journey from ingenue to farm wife has some hairpin turns that the reader will likely never see coming. It's Patchett's great skill as a story master that keeps us as engaged as her daughters, hearing the tale unspool. While the three sisters (yes, in a cherry orchard) demand to know more, we are as eager as they to learn Lara's tale of adventures on stage and off.I tore through this book in a few days, despite a busy end-of-summer schedule.

570,The Covenant of Water (Oprah's Book Club),"Long and dense, but ultimately a beautiful tour de force",Greg Barlin,5,"Phew. I made it. Finished. Complete. Fin.At 776 pages, The Covenant of Water is a commitment. It's long, it's dense, it's heartbreaking more often than it's not, and with every new character introduced, I found myself wondering where it was going and how it might end. But it's also beautifully rendered, meticulously researched, and a tour de force. Given that, I have no idea how I should rate it against everything else I've read this year.The novel spans almost 80 years and takes place primarily in southern India. The story opens in 1900 with the arranged wedding of a 12-year-old girl to a much older man. Following their strained and awkward nuptials, he brings her to his home called Parambil, around which a community has developed. As she begins to learn how to be a wife to her husband, and the awkwardness between them begins to thaw as she grows older, she also comes to learn of her husband's genealogy, and the repeated tragedy that afflicted many of his ancestors. The girl -- who by now has become a young woman and is known as ""Big Ammachi"" -- comes to refer to it as The Condition, whereby an unnatural number of ancestors in her husband's lineage have had an aversion to water and several have died in what would typically be avoidable circumstances involving water.While The Condition crops up as a through line over the course the novel, the book is less about that mysterious affliction than it is a multi-generational character study of a family and the people who move in their circles. The novel flows like a river, with detailed scenes and character development intertwining. The reader, meanwhile, is left to be carried along like an oarless boat upon that river. I will admit that I got frustrated at times with the book. Even by the halfway point, it felt like plenty of story had been told and it was time to wrap things up, yet nearly 400 additional pages still awaited me. What more needs to be told? How will this end? When will it end?There is a passage in the book in which Verghese writes the following:""And now (she) is here, standing in the water that connects them all in time and space and always has. The water she first stepped in minutes ago is long gone and yet it is here, past and present and future inexorably coupled, like time made incarnate. This is the covenant of water: that they're all linked by their acts of commission and omission, and no one stands alone.""Shame on me for doubting Verghese or his intentions, and for presuming these seemingly disconnected pieces wouldn't eventually find one another to complete the puzzle. While I was being carried along the river, Verghese was weaving a complex tapestry around me. Every character and story in the meandering novel has a purpose, and all of that intention is pulled together and made clear In the final 150 (or so) pages. Verghese honors the passage above, and like the water he references, he beautifully ties together the strands of his story.It's been more than a decade since I read Cutting For Stone, and I remember it fondly although the details are admittedly hazy. Acknowledging the hazy memory could be off a bit, I still feel that The Covenant of Water represents Verghese taking his skills to another level. There is plenty of medicine in the book, like in Cutting For Stone, but more broadly than in that work, with Verghese tackling several diseases that have since been mostly eradicated (with leprosy leading the way). Verghese also uses almost 80 years of Indian history and the birth of the nation as a backdrop, starting with the British occupation and class (and caste) systems that evolved around that, through Indian independence and the battle between socialism and a more market-driven economy that followed. The role of women in Indian society is a consistently and critically examined theme. As such, in many ways The Covenant of Water is an ode to the strength and contributions of women, particularly in a more male-dominated society and culture.So how do I rate this beast of a work, which was undeniably brilliant and complex but also struggled to retain my interest at times? For starters, it is the book for which I have the most respect among those I've read this year. I didn't enjoy it the most, and I wouldn't universally recommend it (as I said at the top, it's a commitment). But when I consider the amount of time, and research, and intricate plotting, and effort that went into this, and then compare that to some of the more enjoyable (but less expansive) books among this year's favorites, I have to acknowledge the author's accomplishment. While I didn't love every moment reading the book, and I found myself breaking it up and reading other things in between, I did really enjoy it if I look back on it in its entirety. If it had fizzled to a conclusion, that wouldn't be the case, but I think the final two sections of the book pull everything together in a wonderful way that made me appreciate the purposeful intention of all that came before.For those of us that read regularly, I'm sure we've all thought to ourselves at some point, ""I bet I could write a pretty good novel."" I have certainly read books, good books, and come away still believing (or even being inspired) that I might be able to create something comparable. The Covenant of Water is in a different league, and for anyone harboring aspirations of authorship, it will humble you and remind you that there are many levels to writing, and there are certain levels that are simply unobtainable for all but a few. It's the type of book that illustrates an author operating at the apex of his craft, where all of his skills around writing, planning, dialogue, structure, and research come together to create something beautiful. Go in with eyes wide open -- this will probably dominate your nightstand for several weeks -- but trust that the payoff at the end is worth the journey to get there.",TRUE,01-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2023",802162177
571,The Covenant of Water (Oprah's Book Club),A Monumental and Original Family Saga That Packs an Emotional Wallop,Cathryn Conroy,5,"This is a monumental and original family saga that is like nothing I have ever read. It is richly imaginative and packs an emotional wallop.Taking place in Kerala, a state in South India on the Malabar Coast, it spans nearly 80 years and is brutally realistic. This isn't a sweetsie-lovey story. It's about life. Real life. And it hurts the reader sometimes! Children die, loved ones die by suicide, people are killed in somewhat brutal and violent ways, and several suffer debilitating injuries. It's a tough read because I was emotionally connected with the characters and then wham! They die or suffer. But that is the ultimate premise of this book: Finding the meaning in suffering.Magnificently written by physician and bestselling author Abraham Verghese, this epic multigenerational novel begins in 1900 and ends in 1977, centering on the character of Big Ammachi. She is 12 years old when her father dies, leaving her mother destitute. In a desperate move, this little girl is hurriedly married off to a 40-year-old widower and father of a 2-year-old boy, who lives Kerala, a long day's journey away. She is nicknamed Big Ammachi (Big Mother) by Jojo, the little boy, and the name sticks as she grows up to become the matriarch of a large family living on the 500-acre estate of Parambil. As she soon discovers, this family has a curse, ""the Condition,"" as they call it, that takes the life of someone every generation.In addition, there are parallel stories that at first are seemingly unrelated. The most intriguing one is that of Digby Kilgour, a surgeon from Glasgow, Scotland, who joins the Indian Medical Service in Madras. His is also a story of joy and tragedy that eventually‚Äîsurprisingly and explosively‚Äîconnects with the family in Parambil, although it is a long and circuitous journey to that end.In addition to a compelling, ever-evolving, and multilayered plot inhabited by bold and vivid characters, this is a profound work of literature that speaks eloquently and poignantly about one family's place on Earth‚Äîhow they love, how they argue, how they do good, how they do evil, how they worship God, and how they make the world a better place by just inhabiting it. As you can probably tell from the title, the imagery and symbolism of water and specifically how the covenant of water links all human beings is brilliant.This is also a love letter to medicine‚Äîto dedicated physicians, to the scientists who make the medical discoveries, to the hardworking nurses, and especially to all those who give their life to care for the sick.Bonus: Even though it's told only in words, you'll get a tour of South India that is so vibrant and so realistic that when I Googled photos of the area, it appeared very much like it did in my imagination. The land is so much a part of the novel that it is almost a character of its own. This is truly a magical place with beautiful beaches, elaborate canals, and picturesque mountains filled with monkeys, elephants, snakes, birds, and tigers.Two pieces of advice to make reading this 700+ page book easier:‚Ä¢ There are dozens of characters in this novel, and even the Kindle X-ray feature is not that helpful. Go to the author's website and download the character list. Print it if you're reading the paper version of the book. If you're reading it on Kindle, I advise you to use the ""send to Kindle"" feature. I had this document right next to the book, so it was easy to search for or find the character. It doesn't take long before you'll know who everyone is.‚Ä¢ There are quite a few words in the novel in Malayalam, the official language of Kerala. In most cases, it's easy to figure out the meaning based on the context of the sentence, but I kept my phone nearby so I could Google words I couldn't decipher.",TRUE,27-09-2023,"Reviewed in the United States September 27, 2023",802162177
572,The Covenant of Water (Oprah's Book Club),Two Verghese books in a week - I must be nuts!,Elizabeth L. Boyer,5,"I never write book reviews. Until now. My house is a wreck. Let me explain: I just read two Abraham Verghese books back to back in a week. If you know that author, you understand why I‚Äôve accomplished little else.I just finished his latest, his magnum opus, The Covenant of Water. I had a love-hate relationship with this grand novel. The 765 pages required a big commitment but since I am a voracious reader, that wasn‚Äôt a problem. The love part was because of Verghese‚Äôs outstanding writing. His characters and settings practically jump off the pages. And thanks to the authors everyday occupation as a physician, I now know more about anatomy than I need or want to know! The writing evokes a curiosity that leads to Googling maps of India and researching Indian dissident groups and even looking up the bones of the body. At one point I was ready to book a flight to India. This was getting dangerous.The hate part relates to the same thing: you fall in love with one character and the author moves on to another seemingly unrelated one. Wait, you cry. Don‚Äôt stop there! Well, be patient dear reader. All is not lost or even what it seems.The story is one of things lost and found, of overcoming suffering and moving on with life - themes most of us can relate to in some way. The shifts in time and place and characters caused some confusion, especially when I was listening to the audiobook. This is a book you need to read - I mean really read and pay attention. It is not an easy read: more than once I found myself wondering what the heck that has to do with where this is going. But, true to form, Verghese wraps it up neatly in the last 100 pages. He does go around Robin Hood‚Äôs barn to get there, but in the end it is a very satisfying conclusion: one that earns it ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è on my book list and one of my top five for the year.

It all comes together in the end, beautifully and hauntingly.I've seen some reviews proclaiming this to be a faith-based story, which it certainly is not. That impression may have arisen in that one of the central characters is spiritual, and happens to be a follower of Christianity in a non-Western society. I've seen some reviews claiming it is boring, which I find inexplicable, but realize it may be a challenging read and not for everyone.

620,Haunting Adeline (Cat and Mouse Duet),The Wattpad and AO3 girlies get it,Gen Backes,4,"If you ever had a Wattpad account, this is for you, my friend. A stalker who runs a secret organization to stop human trafficking and wants to lowkey overthrow the government? Who also happens to have mismatched eyes and scars? Sounds like every mafia mc love interest to me.However, this one actually hits. I devoured this book. It's intense, hot, very illegal and problematic, but I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy (almost) every second of it. It was a guilty pleasure read (thank god no one else reads my book because the horror of picking that book up without any warning) and I'm so glad that it's fiction.It's great...until the last two chapters. I understand wanting a cliffhanger, but wtf? No villain reveal? What a load of bs. Also, this would be the root of my main issue with book two. There were no crumbs, no hints, nothing toward the villain's identity. I understand that there was a specific reason for this, wanting to keep the person overlooked, but you can't have a villain reveal/mystery without having enough clues to make the reader guess it. That's mystery 101. You have to reward the reader and the ending just laughs in the reader's face in that department.",TRUE,29-08-2023,"Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2023",B09CGGV8DX
621,Haunting Adeline (Cat and Mouse Duet),"Help, I've fallen in love with a stalker",readwithevelane,5,"There's a reason I don't read incomplete duets or series because then I'm sad when I can't read the next book. I went against my better judgment with this book and I have no regrets (okay I have some because I hated waiting for book two) because I loved this story. The great news is the second book is out now, so you don't have to wait if you're reading this review!I've never read anything remotely similar to this book and I don't know that I ever will. This was my first time reading something truly as dark as this. I've read other books with heavy triggers, but this book was different. I read Satan's Affair beforehand (highly recommend reading that first) and I wasn't entirely sure what this book was going to be about. I knew a past murder, stalking, and love were involved, but that was it. If you had told me one of my top reads from 2021 would've been a stalker romance, I would've laughed in your face. Not only is the romance good, and the spice is off the charts hot, but the overarching story is just so good.Adeline is an author who moves into her grandmother's old home after she passes away. Adeline was close to her grandmother and felt a pull to come back to the home that always fascinated her. While living in the house, she discovers family secrets that have been buried for a long time, secrets involving her great grandmother. Her great grandmother was stalked, but here's the kicker? Her great grandmother had a spicy affair with her stalker! Adeline's great grandmother was murdered and she works with her best friend to figure out who did it. While trying to solve this mystery, Adeline finds herself in the same place as her great grandmother did with a hot stalker.Zade is a leader of a vigilante group that's only mission is to bring down trafficking rings and the horrible people that run them. And not just any type of trafficking rings. Rings that are linked to very powerful people in the country and the world. Zade is determined to get as many women and children to safety as he can. He puts himself in the line of fire to save the lives of the innocent people taken by these rings. He sounds like an ideal guy right? Well, did I mention he's also Adeline's stalker? Zade stumbles across Adeline by accident and it's a wrap for him. He wants to make her his and there's nothing that's going to stop him. Now I'm not saying he's still not an ideal guy (I do love him), but let's just say these are two VERY opposite qualities. On one hand, you have this man trying to save women and child, but on the other hand he's stalking a woman. Many would argue he can't be both a good and terrible guy at the same time, but I think this book begs to differ.I personally loved Adeline and thought she was a dynamic heroine. She was sassy, fun, and radiated fierceness. She does stand up for herself throughout the book, even to Zade, although standing up to him doesn't do much. I liked that we get her inner thoughts on Zade as their relationship plays out. I like watching her slowly open up to him and trust that he'll protect her, which seems like the opposite thing a stalker would do. One of my favorite things was when Adeline told her friend about one of her spicy encounters with Zade and that he ""took her soul"". I couldn't be more jealous of her, trust me. Based on the cliffhanger, book two isn't going to be an easy ride for Adeline, but I know she's going to be okay. Someone as fierce as her work her way through any situation, even if it takes some time.I cannot explain how much I love Zade. I know, I know, he's a stalker. Here's the thing: I just don't care. He really had me contemplating if getting stalked is that bad (it is, but let's ignore that). I loved how he was written to be so multilayered. H.D. Carlton knew what she was doing when she wrote him this way. He's meant to challenge everything you know and make you wonder if he's really all that bad. His qualities are so opposite of each other that he left me spinning so much throughout this book. I would take pauses while reading and say out loud, ""Am I actually into this man?"" or ""I'm in love with this unhinged man. Am I good?"" I laughed way too many times when doing this because I just know how people would react in my life if I told them how much I love Zade. The mouth on Zade is UNMATCHED. God, that man says the wildest stuff, but it's so unbelievably hot. And the things he does with his hands to Adeline? Where do I sign up??? I love his love for Adeline and I can't wait to see what he does in book two knowing how this book ended.The writing in this book is beautiful and so good. H.D. Carlton is talented and it shows in this book. I enjoyed the different storylines taking place and how they all connected to one another. I thought it was interesting to see Adeline live a similar life to her great grandmother. I think getting to read her great grandmother's thoughts on her own personal stalked helped Adeline in her own way. This book is just so so so good! I cannot recommend it enough. I do STRONGLY encourage everyone consider the triggers before reading. I look forward to book two!",TRUE,08-02-2022,"Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2022",B09CGGV8DX

623,Haunting Adeline (Cat and Mouse Duet),this book remade my moral compass,Nat,5,"just a warning: do NOT pick up this book expecting something kind or sweet to happen, it won‚Äôt. Please check the trigger warnings.premise- Adeline Reilly is a 26 year old indie author who has just moved into her late grandmother‚Äôs gothic and creepy manor- she absolutely loves this.Her life is turned upside down when she caught the attention of a powerful and known vigilante, who takes down trafficking rings and saves women and children for a living. Zade Meadows is not one to be messed with.. especially if it involves his new found obsession- Adeline. And when I say obsession, I mean stalking. I don‚Äôt consider it a romance novel, but yes indeed, this is a dark romance. Emphasize on dark because nothing about this book is normally cute. I‚Äôll explain myself.the story- Haunting Adeline is a book that dives deep down into the evil side of humanity, actually- it dives into the side where there is none. Despite its ‚Äúdark romance‚Äù label, I have to unfortunately label it, reality. While there is romance in the book, it is not your peaches and cream type romance. More like blood and insanity. We follow along to see Adeline be stalked by Zade since the moment he laid eyes on her, he does everything in his power to make her his, even when she says no.the world building- is insanely accurate to real life, it IS real life. H.D. Carlton did a fantastic job at capturing the essence of what goes on in this messed up world. The accuracy scared me more than the story did, and that‚Äôs a great thing to me!the trigger warnings- please read them, if you‚Äôre not someone like me who now looks at these lists like a shopping list, then please read the warnings.my thoughts- listen.. there are zero words I can gather to express how this book made me feel, other than I. LOVE. IT. I couldn‚Äôt even tell you why. Maybe it has something to do with the characters? It could be the LEVEL OF INTENSITY Zade‚Äôs obsession with Adeline is at? Maybe it‚Äôs that he‚Äôs quite literally a walking ironic, vigilante? Or is it that this book and the relationship to me screams ‚Äúdeadly love‚Äù? At this point, I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm just as deranged as Adeline because while Haunting is dark- and Hunting Adeline is darker.. it had me giggling and kicking my feet like an excited 4 year old, the chokehold Zade has on me is probably unhealthy, but I‚Äôm in the accepting stage so, let‚Äôs roll with it.conclusion- I‚Äôm not going to sit here and lie or pretend.. by the end of this review, you may believe I‚Äôm deranged, maybe even crazy. This story had me burning through the pages, I finished it in 12 hours to then pick up Hunting and finish that in under 5. I could not put it down. Yes, I read the trigger warnings. Yes, this is the first book I jumped into dark romance with. No, I don‚Äôt regret it at all.. especially now because dark romance is my weakness. If this is the worst out there, and I just strolled through it like I was in a park, then I say bring it on to others.You will either hate this book with all your being, or absolutely love it so much, it hurts.. like me.

I also appreciated how sometimes we would get a chapter from the Manipulator‚Äôs perspective and then the next chapter would be The Shadow‚Äôs perspective of the previous chapter but then it would continue or give a little more information. It was thrilling to read and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who likes smut, true crime investigations, and Law & Order SVU. JUST READ THE DAMN BOOK!‚ö†Ô∏èSpoilers below!!!!!!‚ö†Ô∏èLike seriously this is my summary so‚Ä¶ expectMAJORSPOILERS:Adeline is an author who falls prey to a stalker. Not just an ordinary stalker, but a tech-saavy, rich, vigilante stalker who ironically saves women and children by day and stalks HER by night. He‚Äôs no joke either, he told her not to let a guy at a club touch her, and so to spite him she brings him back to her house for a little woohoo action, well ‚ÄúThe Shadow‚Äù doesn‚Äôt like it and interrupts by banging on her door and then when boy wonder comes out, ‚Äúthe shadow‚Äù kidnaps him and kills him slowly, as a punishment to Addie for not listening to him he gifts her a box with boy wonders SEVERED HANDS. The sexual tension and fear slowly build each chapter after that. Hard to believe he did her a favor, but the guy she was hooking up with was actually a terrible guy. Any who, The Shadow - aka Zade- does a bunch of messed up things but then a bunch of hell yeah things so as the reader you end up rooting for him. OH!!! and also while all this is going on, Adeline is trying to solved her GREAT grandmothers murder which also involves a stalker but by the end we realize it was this guy Frank (a man who wanted to be her lover but kills her when he finds out she is cheating and not with him). Oh and she‚Äôs doing this with her best friend Daya who happens to work for ZADE doing illegal hacking stuff.Anyways..the book ENDS with ZADE and Jay having a gun to their heads because the underground ritual was a setup and also Adeline was taken by two mafia guys at the request of Max. Sooo I will have to read Hunting Adeline to find out what happens.Ending Thoughts: The way this ends makes it seem like Max is the one threatening Jay and ZADE during the ritual after the explosion, especially since he was the one who sent for Adeline to be extracted. Also, does the little girl and Michael survive? I hope they were able to get out. And Daya.. she had to be taken too since she wasn‚Äôt answering her phone.

626,Haunting Adeline (Cat and Mouse Duet),4.5 stars TiTok made me and I'm so glad I listened,Jennifer,4,"Okay so I was worried that this book had too much hype and wouldn't be good. It also came with so many trigger warnings I though it would be hard to read.First let me say yes there are dark themes like child trafficking and very dark romantic kinks, but it doesn't go into enough detail really to warrant the extreme triggers people talk about. I've read fantasy dark romances that have more blood and sadistic tendencies with more descriptions.With that being said, I couldn't put it down. The alternating POV is perfect and the storyline is fantastic so if you removed or skimmed over the spicy scenes due to uncomfortable, the book would still grab your attention.Only reason I'm giving it 4.5 instead of 5 stars is because I got annoyed with Adeline's back and forth on her feelings and the damn foreshadowing of a pregnancy.

627,Haunting Adeline (Cat and Mouse Duet),I'm a complete mess right now.,Chelsea,5,This book absolutely broke me. My moral compass is so confused and oddly I'm okay with it. I'm writing this review after reading books 1 and 2 as well as Satan's Affair. I do recommend reading the books in order starting with the novella as you are introduced to Sibby & Zade. The timelines will make sense and questions will be answered in the Haunting Adeline.I enjoyed the love story between Adeline and Zade as well as the sub plot with Adeline finding her grandmothers letters and learning she had a stalker as well.

The book starts with sharing a playlist and a trigger warning (see third picture for all sensitive content). This is a wonderful cat and mouse game between author Adeline Reilly and her mysterious stalker ‚ÄúZ‚Äù. Filled with intrigue, murder, and extra spice, the book carries you through to end on a massive cliffhanger. I would definitely recommend having the second and final book on hand.

629,Haunting Adeline (Cat and Mouse Duet),It's disturbingly good,K,5,"Can I just say, I had no idea that I would ever be reading a book like this. As a writer myself, I was sucked in by the authors words. I almost felt as though, Adeline, was really H.D. Carlton in disguise! she really is, the manipulator.Spoiler Alert!!!!!Adeline and Zade, they are kind of perfect for each other.Adeline is strong willed and outspoken. She has no problem saying how she feels. She tends to do this throughout the first book. Her smart mouth lands her into a lot of trouble, and I must say, I am intrigued, because I am that way myself.Zade is a self made man. He works to rectify the injustices of human trafficking, and despite being noble and striving to change the world, he becomes infatuated with our girl Adeline. Obsession at first sight.I loved the cat and mouse chase, it was perfect and like I said, I couldn't put it down!Character development is my number one thing in books, I cannot stand a romance book that has zero character development and just mindless sex scenes. But haunting went above and beyond my expectations.I loved the back story, and the inclusion of the past with the present. Adeline's curiosity about her grandmothers death, the diary, her history with her mother. It was so easy to follow, despite being loaded with details that anyone can easily miss. In fact, I reread the book a second time, and then caved and got the audiobook which has the best voice narrators! (if I may add, I normally HATE the audiobook versions of books, mainly because I find that the voice narrators, give the characters no personality and their performance feels so dry, it makes me not want to finish listening, but the voice narrators selected for this book.....oh my lord.....)Haunting, was the type of read where I found myself questioning a lot of things, mainly with myself and my own tastes. I never thought I would be able to read such a dark book but wow. I was entrapped.I have purchased Hunting Adeline, and cannot wait to dive into the next one.",TRUE,06-09-2023,"Reviewed in the United States September 6, 2023",B09CGGV8DX
630,Verity,"Dark, Twisted, & Shocking -- Lives up to the Hype!",JHSiess,4,"Verity opens with author Lowen Ashleigh having a very bad morning. Her mother died the previous week after a year-long battle with colon cancer. Lowen had a difficult relationship with her mother -- ""a direct result of my own mother being terrified of me,"" she relates -- but still brought her to Lowen's apartment and cared for her during the last nine months of her life. Lowen is a sleepwalker and her mother kept her fairly secluded as a child, afraid of what Lowen might be capable of doing during one of many sleepwalking episodes. Now she has left her apartment in New York City for the first time in weeks, summoned to a meeting at her publisher's office by her literary agent, Corey, with whom she was previously in an intimate relationship. Just as Lowen is waiting for a crosswalk light to change, a man steps into the street and is struck by a truck. Lowen is understandably shaken, and the man's blood is splattered on her face and white shirt.A handsome stranger escorts her into a coffee shop bathroom and literally gives her the shirt off his back. They chat briefly, and Loewn concludes that he ""wants to be invisible in this city. Just like me."" After all, she moved to New York to become part of the city's invisible millions of invisible residents. Her books have not sold well enough for her publisher to offer her another contract unless she agrees to promote them, something she has refused to do in the past. ""I'm so awkward I'm afraid once my readers meet me in person, they'll swear off my books forever,"" Lowen laments. ""That's why I stay home and write. I think the idea of me is better than the reality of me."" But another contract was her last hope. She took time off from her writing career believing that her mother would leave her some money. Now, having lived off the advance she received after signing her prior contract, she has learned that she will receive nothing from her mother's estate. And be homeless soon, unless she receives a job offer.When Lowen arrives at her publisher's office, she is shocked to find the man whose shirt she is wearing is attending the same meeting. He is Jeremy Crawford, husband of Verity, a very successful author who is unable to complete the series of books she was writing. Lowen is being offered a flat fee of seventy-five thousand dollars per book to write the last three volumes in the series, with the first installment due in six months. Lowen is determined to turn down the offer until Jeremy informs her that he selected her because Verity read one of Lowen's books and it was among her favorites. She purportedly told Jeremy that they shared a similar writing style and Lowen was destined to be ""the next big thing."" Verity has been catastrophically injured in a motor vehicle accident, following the deaths of both of her daughters, Chastin and Harper, leaving Jeremy to raise their young son, Crew, alone. Lowen ultimately agrees to take on the project.Lowen makes the six-hour drive to the Crawford home in Vermont, listening to the audio version of the first book in the series en route. She is to spend time in Verity's office, reviewing the research and notes she left there in order to assess how best to approach writing the next book. Lowen meets Crew and learns that Verity's condition is extremely serious. She is in a virtually catatonic state -- uncommunicative and unable to care for herself. Caregivers spend the day in the home, with Jeremy managing at night. Lowen soon discovers that Verity's office lacks organization -- her expansive desk is strewn with stacks from end to end with papers and files, and boxes containing more documents line the walls. Clearly, the process of sorting through it all will take much longer than Lowen originally anticipated. As she begins reading Verity's second book, she realizes the ""books are from the villain's point of view"" and she will need ""time to work myself into that mindset while writing."" Jeremy claims that he has never read Verity's books because he ""didn't like being inside her head.""Author Colleen Hoover recounts Lowen's story via a first-person narrative, with the story really taking off as Lowen attempts to settles into the Crawford home. She is keenly observant and inquisitive about Verity's writing, as well as her family, and quickly finds herself attracted to Jeremy, who is still married to the incapacitated woman being cared for in an upstairs bedroom. Searching through Verity's office, Lowen stumbles upon a manuscript entitled ""So Be It."" Verity hopes it is an outline for the next book, but it is instead an autobiography drafted by Verity. Reading it is not what she has been hired to do, but she justifies her insatiable curiosity by construing her review of the manuscript as research. ""I need to see how Verity's mind works to understand her as a writer."" Soon she is absorbed in Verity's descriptions of meeting Jeremy, the development of their relationship and the early days of their marriage, as well as her pregnancies and motherhood. The more she reads, the more frightened of Verity Lowen becomes, especially when events she observes appear to be inconsistent with what she has been told about Verity's condition. Nonetheless, Lowen continues returning to the manuscript to better understand the Crawford family's history, and gain insight into Jeremy and Verity's marriage. But Lowen is playing a dangerous game. Verity's purported autobiography is a dark and disturbing confession of Verity's feelings, motivations, and unspeakably vile acts. Lowen believes the manuscript to be an accurate depiction of Verity's life, and concludes that it ""was written by a very disturbed woman -- a woman whose house I currently inhabit.""Hoover ramps up the tension as Lowen becomes entangled in a budding relationship with Jeremy, influenced heavily by what she is reading in the manuscript. Verity's revelations are horrifying, and as Lowen and Jeremy grow closer, he increasingly opens up to her, sharing details of his life with Verity about which Lowen feigns ignorance. Lowen's suspicions about the accident in which Verity was injured grow. Is Jeremy being completely honest with Lowen? Why is he willing to embark on a new relationship with Lowen when his wife, although injured, is still alive? He claims that he cannot move Verity to a care facility because Crew cannot sustain another loss. While Verity is cared for in their home, Crew can spend unlimited amounts of time at her bedside. Lowen now possesses detailed information about the deaths of Jeremy's daughters. Were their deaths really tragic accidents? Is Crew safe?Hoover's characters are both fascinating and infuriating. The story is related solely from Lowen's perspective. Her childhood was difficult because of her sleepwalking and the way it detrimentally impacted her relationship with her mother. She has achieved modest success as a writer, but because of her discomfort in social situations, her career growth has been stymied. She accepts the offer to write Verity's next three books because she desperately needs the money, but also because it is an opportunity too good to pass up. But she is confused not only by her burgeoning attraction to Jeremy, but the incongruity between what she has been told about Verity's accident and what transpires in the house. Of course, Lowen's feelings and experiences are colored by the information set forth in the manuscript. Interestingly, Hoover has said that even when she depicts Lowen reading Verity's manuscript, readers are ""still not fully in Verity‚Äôs head because we‚Äôre always in Lowen‚Äôs perspective, reading something she found. When I write a book from one character‚Äôs point of view, I rarely think about the story from the other character‚Äôs perspectives. Sometimes it‚Äôs necessary for certain scenes, but with this book, it was important for me to feel the confusion and fear Lowen felt. So as the author, I had to be completely blind to what was happening from everyone else's perspectives."" Still, as the story progresses, Hoover keeps readers guessing as to how gullible and vulnerable Lowen really is. She believes the manuscript is truthful and accurate, and that Jeremy is not the villain -- if, in fact there is a villain in the Crawfords' story. But could Lowen possibly be opportunistic, calculating, and willing to do anything to be with Jeremy?Jeremy is equally captivating. He is handsome, charming, successful, and by all outward appearances, a family man who has sustained unimaginable losses who has been able to soldier on only because he has a young son to raise. To be fair, although Verity's prognosis is never affirmatively established, his desire to move on with his life is understandable -- Verity sustained a serious head injury which will, in all likelihood, preclude her from resuming a fully normal life. But was his meeting with Lowen on the street just before the meeting at her publisher's office really just coincidental? Did he intend for her to find the manuscript in Verity's office? Has he been fully aware of its contents all along? About that, Hoover says, ""I‚Äôm not sure because I was never in Jeremy‚Äôs head."" In other words, readers can draw their own conclusions, based on the evidence Hoover does present.And what about Verity? Is she selfishly conniving and evil, as the manuscript suggests? Or is she a blameless grieving mother who was tragically injured in a horrific car accident?The manuscript provides myriad complications. Lowen debates whether she should discuss it with Jeremy. She doesn't believe he is aware of its existence or content. He claimed he never read Verity's books, after all. Lowen learns that Verity was injured when her vehicle hit a tree, but there were no skidmarks on the pavement. She concludes Verity ""either fell asleep or she did it on purpose."" Does it matter to Lowen which scenario is accurate? What conclusion has Jeremy drawn about the cause of the accident?Putting aside the perspective from which the story is told, no aspect of the story or the characters can be accepted at face value. Hoover includes plot twists so shocking and unnerving that Verity, originally published in 2018, continues to be one of the most-discussed psychological thrillers ever written. (There is even a Facebook discussion group devoted to the book, boasting nearly twenty-five thousand members!) The book is fast-paced, engrossing, and extremely entertaining. The story's pace gradually accelerates with each surprising development and breath-taking revelations of the truth or, perhaps, a manipulated version of the truth. The tale careens to a jaw-dropping conclusion that will keep readers thinking, discussing, and debating Hoover's extremely clever and nuanced tale, as well as her deliciously intriguing and morally ambiguous characters (who may prove themselves to be not as ambiguous as originally thought) for a very, very long time. Hoover says she ""chose the ending because it‚Äôs frightening to me. It‚Äôs my biggest nightmare For the darkness in the worlds I create as a writer to somehow"" intrude into her real life.Thanks to Grand Central Publishing for a copy of the book.",TRUE,13-01-2022,"Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2022",1538724731

And even in this book, I was like that as well‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs an explanation for later. Because I truly enjoyed this story!

But why am I on Etsy about to buy a shirt that says ‚ÄúWingspan Matters‚Äù? Why are there Velaris stickers in my cart? And why is Rhysand so damn irresistible???I‚Äôm doomed. I‚Äôm drinking the kool-aid and I don‚Äôt even remember it coming into my hand. Oh‚Ä¶god.In this second book of the series, we continue to follow Feyre after she saves Prythian from that crazy red headed demon woman with blue balls for Tamlin (lol) and she gets to head home with her flower beast man, but realizes that life as the soon-to-be wife of the High Lord of Spring Court is not what she thought it would be. Everyday was boring, soul shattering, depressing, and a prison. But the only freedom she has is that one week of the month with Rhysand at the Night Court. The story progresses as Feyre finds her strength in herself and others, learns not to judge a book by its cover, and that family (even if it‚Äôs found) and love (when is deep and true) is worth dying for.You see there? I spoke highly of the girl! Because GOD DAMN was she killing me all ACOTAR and up to Chapter 34 in ACOMAF. Feyre‚Äôs absolute selfishness and denial is so insufferable that I had to put the book down, walk away, and scream into a pillow. She is a walking billboard for ‚Äúpity parties‚Äù and ‚Äúmisery loves company‚Äù. She is manipulative and honestly a liability. She only cares about herself and what others can do to benefit her. She doesn‚Äôt want to understand people but wants people to understand her. Pot meet Kettle. I don‚Äôt like Feyre. I AM VERY ANTI FEYRE.But holy smoke, am I loving her journey! The world building and character development is absolutely amazing. Maas knows how to write a book! I literally am transported to this world when I read like I‚Äôm watching a movie on a big screen. I have fallen in love with the characters (even Nesta!). I am envious of the beauty and danger of this world. I am absolutely desperate to pick up the next book in the series and keep going and going and going. This series is fantastic so far. Fantastic!When it comes to favorite characters, I will have to say Rhysand the one. How well written is this man that you feel his pain and pure desperation to save his found family and city. To stand up for the people around him and build a home and community he‚Äôs proud of. Plus he is sexy as hell! Take ME far away so I can hear that roar. But that pain in MY hair! Also, Amren‚Ä¶oooooo y‚Äôall look out for her! Badass incarnate and I can not WAIT to see what she is and where she came from.Also another favorite for me in this books is the Summer Court scenes. Tarquin, though not a massive part in this book, is a man you can easily fall in love with. Dark skin and white hair amongst a beautiful never ending summer lane. Loved it! I could literally smell the salt air and hear the gulls. The beauty described filled my mind and the chaos of the situation/mission made my heart pound with excitement and awe.So yea, I may be a Feyre hater‚Ä¶but it has not stopped me from seeing the vision Maas is showing in the ACOTAR series. I can say I will probably love Feyre by the end of it all. She shows signs of hope. But man, am I invested in this world! Take me away, Ms. Maas.

642,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 2)","Feyre is healing from Under the Mountain, but is she really? (SPOILERS)",Alyshia,5,"o I LOVED this book, along with every other reader. However, it‚Äôs not my favorite book in the series (I‚Äôm writing this online review after completing the series BUT from the notes I took while reading for the first time).o We certainly do love a Rhysand show, don‚Äôt we? We all made the mistake of liking Tamlin in the first book, you‚Äôre not alone. I love Rhys‚Äô character so much. Brooding, bad boy with the good reasons. We love that.o OVERVIEW: SPOILERS. Feyre returned to the Spring Court with Tamlin. Only to find that Tamlin had become so overprotective of her she wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave the manor. So she stayed there planning for everything with Ianthe, the priestess that Tamlin had brought in. Planning the wedding, planning the flowers, things that she couldn‚Äôt have cared any less about. We find Feyre falling more and more into the darkness. However, while she is there fighting with Tamlin on everything, Rhysand shows up to make good on his bargain after 3 months of peace where everyone assumed he‚Äôd forgotten about it. Although she doesn‚Äôt want to go, she does. And there, she learns to read and write because Rhys saw in the trials that she couldn‚Äôt. He teaches her with sentences like ‚ÄúRhysand is the most handsome high lord‚Äù, and the like. We love that for him & his twisted sense of humor and narcissism.o However, Feyre captures a Suriel (our favorite gossip queen) and he tells her ‚ÄúStay with the High Lord and see everything righted‚Äù So, the day of the wedding of Tamlin and Feyre (feeling like she is doing as the Suriel told her) comes and she has a hideous dress that she hates on that Ianthe picked out. As she is walking own the isle toward Tamlin she is silently shouting in her head for ANYONE to stop it. She is beginning to panic. And a special dark knight in shining armor shows up just in time as Feyre stopped in the aisle because she couldn‚Äôt go any further. Rhys then whisks her away.o There she decides that she is not returning to the Spring Court and being locked in that house.o So begins Feyre‚Äôs real healing at Velaris and the Night Court.o I did indeed love this book so much. Feyre‚Äôs internal struggle just fractured my heart throughout the entire thing. Her spiraling into despair and Tamlin not noticing but Rhys noticing that she was coming to him during his weeks, frail and full of nothing was so amazing.o Watching their characters develop a relationship was amazing.

643,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 2)",All hail High Lord Rhys,Bailee Williams,4,"I really debated rating this one higher cause I gave ACOTAR four stars and I definitely liked this one better, but it didn‚Äôt quite feel like a 4.5 or 5 star read. I‚Äôm so consistent üòÖANYWAY, getting into my actual thoughts‚Ä¶where do I find myself an Illyrian? Like, for real. How is it that Rhys, Cassian, AND Azriel are all the ACTUAL BEST.Following the trend I‚Äôve seen, I love Rhys, and Tamlin can go rot in hell. That‚Äôs how much I disliked him in this book. I loved seeing how much Under the Mountain affected Feyre, and I really liked all of her interactions with the Inner Circle. The Inner Circle in general is like actually the best part of this book.THE. TENSION. is so freaking good. I think the tension itself was better than the spice (though the spice was üå∂Ô∏è ü•µüëå), but only because the tension was soooo damn good. It‚Äôs like 300 pages of tension and buildup and I was dying. But loving it. Obviously.It was such a great fantasy read to jump into and finish within like 48 hours. Though I am kicking myself for not having ACOWAR already in my house before I finished this one. Definitely make sure you have the whole series ready.Spoiler talk:I wasn‚Äôt a fan of Elaine and Lucien being mates.

It was just meh.Also, what is with SJM and intentionally holding back major plot points from readers just to surprise us?? I was somewhat okay with it when it was just Aelin doing it in ToG, but I‚Äôm not a fan of it here.

644,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 2)","The ending was stunning, as always, but I had character issues.",Brittany,4,"** Warning: This is NOT a spoiler-free review like I usually write. I won‚Äôt give away twists from the very end but I WILL be discussing things that happened throughout the beginning and middle of the book! **I was pleasantly surprised when I read A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES last year because going into it, I knew it was a story with a strong fae presence. By this point in time in my reading career, I wasn‚Äôt new to fantasy but I was still a bit picky about what sort of fantasy I liked and fae did not fall into that category of selected themes‚Ä¶ But knowing how much I loved Sarah‚Äôs Throne of Glass series and the fae presence there, I dove into ACOTAR and loved it! It had a bit of a BREAKING DAWN ending so I wasn‚Äôt quite sure where the second book would go but naturally I had very, very high hopes for it since I hadn‚Äôt been let down by a Maas book yet!I won‚Äôt sugar coat it ‚Äî it actually took me a really long time to get into the swing of this book. I was enjoying the plot but the beginning felt so incredibly dramatic and I just didn‚Äôt feel like things were moving forward. There was a lot of time spent on Feyre‚Äôs PTSD from her time Under the Mountain and I absolutely understand and don‚Äôt think that her traumatic experience should be just brushed over. I do felt like there was too much time dwelling on it though. ACOMAF isn‚Äôt a short book and I think some pages could have been saved and still gotten the point across throughout a few sections in the beginning. If the book were more character-based instead of plot-driven, it might have been more appropriate but the plot really seemed to suffer because of this and this isn‚Äôt the first time I felt this way in a Maas book either. I understand that these characters have gone through something that truly does change them but I felt like I was reading about totally different characters when I started ACOMAF. Feyre and Tamlin were just not themselves and I think had ACOTAR ended with a bit more of this shadow or if it had slowly creeped in throughout ACOMAF, it wouldn‚Äôt have been as much of a surprise. I just really felt like I was thrown into a totally new environment and it was really hard for me to adjust to, especially since I had read ACOTAR over a year before I got to start ACOMAF.I continued to have issues with Feyre throughout the book. I don‚Äôt know why but she was just really bothering me. Instead of snarky, witty comebacks, I felt like everything with her was taken as an insult and she was constantly being defensive and kind of hated everyone. It was really hard to watch her interact with characters and I started to latch onto new (or new-to-the-spotlight) characters like Rhysand and his gang. It did make me extra thankful for Rhys coming onto the scene and shaking things up, though! The interactions between Feyre and Tamlin were just unbearable and painful to read. Then I ended up on the flip side where although I didn‚Äôt want Feyre and Tamlin to still be together, I also felt really weird that Tamlin was almost totally absent from this book. He was there in the beginning and I won‚Äôt speak of the ending but this book was straight up about Feyre and Rhysand and it almost felt like a waste that we spent all that time building up a romance between Feyre and Tamlin in ACOTAR to have it totally change. I absolutely love where it went but it‚Äôs confusing to understand why the Feyre/Tamlin romance was so important and developed in ACOTAR and why Rhysand wasn‚Äôt more of a main character throughout that courtship to really get his foot even more in the door.I‚Äôve followed the romances in Sarah J. Maas‚Äô books quite well, I think, considering they‚Äôre not always simple and straightforward. I know some people who have issues with love triangles or already have their OTPs with the first love interest really have trouble moving with the characters as they fall out of love or move from one interest to realize that their true match is someone else and I feel like I‚Äôve followed along with that fairly easily. I can see where people feel like the romance in ACOMAF is a love triangle and I guess to a certain extent it is, but Feyre also does not have interest in both men at the same time. It is quite complicated though so if you‚Äôre sensitive about triangles, you almost definitely won‚Äôt like the romance.I personally loved the development of Rhysand as a love interest, especially once Feyre really started to struggle with Tamlin. I found it telling that at the hardest points in their lives, Feyre and Tamlin drifted apart and just couldn‚Äôt find a way to even communicate instead of being able to rely on one another and get through a hard time together. That doesn‚Äôt always mean that you shouldn‚Äôt be with someone but in the case of story telling, it‚Äôs a pretty big sign that the main character isn‚Äôt where they should be. I‚Äôve heard this complaint from other Maas readers but this is the first of her books where I really felt like the romance started to take over the book. While I did love the new Rhysand/Feyre development, I felt like there was a lot of back and forth between them before anything major (finally) happened and that could have been cut down to some more meaningful interactions instead of repetitive, similar situations that happened more than a few times throughout the course of the story. Their romance actually is a very important part of the plot so it‚Äôs not like I wanted it to be downplayed but I just felt like so many points of the large general story were pushed aside to develop the romantic moments and it started to turn more romance story than epic fantasy ‚Äî and yes, there are some cheesy romance book-worthy moments. Let‚Äôs just say this is NOT A YOUNG ADULT BOOK, friends. There are some very explicit scenes so if you have teens or are directing/teaching teens who are reading this series, you may not want to put this book directly into their hands. (Not that I‚Äôm saying censor them but. Ya know. Read it first so you know what you‚Äôre giving them.)The sections where the plot progressed were really quite delightful. Sarah J. Maas is still a master at layering stories and it‚Äôs so interesting to see how much of a previous book comes back in a different light in a subsequent book. There were so many moments that the reader is able to recognize from ACOMAF and see from a different character‚Äôs perspective or reassess it with more information and it makes the story that much deeper! Once things started to really take off around halfway through and a little thereafter, the book was simply addicting and I couldn‚Äôt wait to see where the entire plot of the series was going! Sarah really does have an amazing ability to craft an overall series arc and it‚Äôs so fun to watch that develop. The ending positively floored me and it was hard to remember why I had been so frustrated for a while throughout earlier sections of the book. So many things were revealed, actions taken, and trusts betrayed that I just really didn‚Äôt know what was coming. The twists and surprises were epic and once again, I was left in utter anticipation of the next book!",TRUE,29-06-2016,"Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2016",1635575583
645,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 2)","I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again.",Mikee Andrea Quiambao,5,"*Review originally posted on Goodreads*‚ùùI was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again. I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.‚ùûA Court of Thorns and Roses was one of the first books I started reading that got me into Fantasy and reviewing books. Way back when this series, the Throne of Glass series, and Sarah J. Maas, herself, wasn't hyped up like there's no tomorrow. It was the first book I've read by Sarah J. Maas and the reason I picked up the Throne of Glass series because I just needed more SJM in my life.I was satisfied with the way things ended in ACOTAR so when I heard that some ""changes"" were going to be made in A Court of Mist and Fury, I was a little disappointed. I was NOT a fan of the changes that were made in the Throne of Glass series which was why I haven't picked up Queen of Shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day it's been released. That's just my opinion. I know some SJM fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that Sarah could absolutely do no wrong. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE SARAH J. MAAS. She is an outstanding author. I love her writing, her characters, and the world that she brings to life. It was her books that changed my perspective on Young Adult Fantasy, but I honestly wouldn't say that I agree with every direction that SJM takes with her books.I suppose the questions to ask now are: what was my stance at the end of ACOTAR and how did I perceive the changes that were made after reading ACOMAF?Let me address the most important aspect of Sarah J. Maas's books, this series, and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most: THE ROMANCE. Since A Court of Thorns and Roses was a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast, my ship of course was none other than Tamlin and Feyre. I loved them as individuals and I loved them even more as a couple. AND I loved Rhysand. Just not as a love interest. I felt like Feyre wasn't worthy of the enigma that was Rhysand. But knowing the trend that SJM follows in all of her books, I figured a change in love interests was inevitable. After all, a book isn't written by Sarah J. Maas if there isn't some character butchering and changes in love interests involved.But after reading A Court of Mist and Fury, I actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise. As much as I wanted Tamlin and Feyre to stay together, I knew it wasn't going to happen. These two people that survived weren't the same people that were Under the Mountain. They're relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy. It was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happen.In the beginning of this series, I understood where Tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of Feyre. It was for Feyre's own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love and/or care about. But he took it way too far. He became too overbearing to the point where he was holding Feyre back. We all understood the trials and suffering that Feyre had to go through but I feel like people don't acknowledge what Tamlin had to go through as well while they were Under the Mountain. It was nothing close to what Feyre had to go through but Tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die. He couldn't protect her the way he wanted and he didn't fight for her as he knew he very well could have. He was helpless and a coward. I think he realized this, which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where she's being suffocated. It still doesn't excuse what Tamlin does in this book but he's just another damaged character like Feyre and Rhysand. He's just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book. Tamlin loves Feyre, that much is evident. He just loves her too much, and that is the tragedy.As for Rhysand, all I can say is that I loved him in ACOTAR and I loved him even more in A Court of Mist and Fury. I loved that we finally get a good understanding of Rhys as a character, the secrets he's kept, and the sacrifices he's made for the good of his people and his court. He was everything that Tamlin was not and twice the man and High Lord that Tamlin will ever be. I'm not completely sure if I'm 100% on board with Feyre and Rhysand yet but I love their chemistry, friendship, and the way they just understand and respect one another. I think I would've been head over heels in love with Feyre and Rhys instantly as a couple if ACOTAR never happened and I didn't get so attached to Feyre and Tamlin. But I no longer ship Tamlin/Feyre and I'm slowly, but surely, beginning to fall in love with Rhysand and Feyre little by little.With romance aside, everything about A Court of Mist and Fury turned out every bit as great as I anticipated a year ago. Sarah J. Maas did not disappoint. I was preparing myself for the worst but instead I got the best. Sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing, worldbuilding, and characters that she has created. Of all the new things that were introduced in this book, the new characters of the Night Court were definitely my favorite. I thought the Spring Court was great in ACOTAR with characters like Lucien and Alis but the Night Court was at a whole new level with Cassian, Azriel, Morrigan, and Amren. BADASS is literally an understatement describing these new characters.Besides Rhysand and Feyre, ACOMAF introduced so many new ships and I can't handle all the perfectness that everyone is. I now ship Mor and Azriel with all of my being, just putting it out there. XD And Cassian and Nesta. And Lucian and Elain. None for you Tamlin.Overall, I was glad I waited to read A Court of Mist and Fury because as a result, I was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that Sarah J. Maas was taking the series. Love her or hate her, Sarah can write one hell of a story and is such an outstanding author. Although there were some parts of the book that went by a little slow, I think A Court of Mist and Fury was even better than ACOTAR in more ways than one. Sometimes I find that sequels may suffer ""middle book syndrome"" but ACOMAF amplifies that momentum knowing that Sarah is preparing to hurtle anticipation and suffering our way for the conclusion of the A Court of Thorns and Roses trilogy.",TRUE,24-08-2016,"Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2016",1635575583

649,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 2)",Rhysand + You = Hurry up and read this book!,Amazon Customer,5,"This book was everything I had hoped it would, and SO MUCH more! I loved it as much as I love Rhysland. There, I said it. There's romance, sensuality, character growth, action, betrayal, friendships, family ties, and so much more. The character developments, the story telling, the world building, and the way Maas wrote this story is AWESOME! This book is the packaged deal. Okay, I'll admit it, Rhysand is the packaged deal in this book.I knew there was much more to Rhysand than we got to know in A Court of Thorns and Roses. Boy is there a lot more to him! I loved the way I got to know him in this book. Maas held things back from readers, allowing us to get to know Rhysand as Feyre got to know him. Part of that is what made it easier to fall in love with his character. The more I got to know him, the easier it was for me to really see him for who he was, and in turn made it easy to see the differences between him and Tamlin. Rhysland is that character you want on your side. He's loyal to those close to him, doesn't apologize for who he really is, doesn't hold back when it comes to loving a certain someone, and unlike some characters, he sees Feyre for all that she really is, and allows her to be who she is, and all that she's becoming.Despite the fact he can make anyone do anything he wants, Rhysland gives Feyre choices, and allows her to make them. He wants her to be who she wants to be. Rhysand a character that readers will get to see all sides of, and fall in love with in the process. I love the way he treats Feyre, and his court. He's very powerful, someone to fear, yet for all the darkness that resides within him, I came to understand how the darkness he has calms and brings peace to Feyre. He is that person who isn't only compassionate and loyal when it comes to his court, he's someone who knows how to treat to a woman. He treats Feyre with so much love, respect and understanding. *sigh* Just wait until you see how he treats her... you won't be able to resist falling for him either. I've completely fallen in love with his character.Feyre by all means is an equal to Rhys. Not only did I love their banter, electric chemistry, and those hot scenes between them ( I swear the pages ignited in this book more than a few times), I loved how she fell for Rhysand. The more I got to know him, the more I understood how she slowly started to fall for him. It was natural and made sense. Most importantly, I loved that she realized she is worth so much more than she's ever thought. I loved that she grew into a strong, fierce character/women who not only learned to love herself, but love someone who truly loved her, and didn't want to keep her in a cage. I loved that she learned to fight, and embrace her powers, both literally and figuratively. She grew so much, and I loved that she became a force to reckon with. What I admired the most about Feyre's character development in this book, is that she learned to love herself. She learned to embrace who she is, and all that she is. I respected her even more for that.The romance and character chemistry in this book was on fire! The banter, and flirting between Rhysand and Feyre was, well that's just say these two know how to push each other's buttons, and get under each other's skin in all the right ways. Together, Feyre and Rhysland are something amazing. Aside from all the physical aspects, and passion these two share, I love that they chase away the darkness that threatens to consume the other. They both have experienced horrific things that they are still dealing with. They are each other's hope, and light. They're there for each other and help pull each other out of the darkness, or sometimes are there to hold the other as they endure the nightmares.One of the things I liked about theme of love in this book, is the way Feyre came to realize what it truly meant to be loved and be in love, vs what she thought love was. I appreciated the fact that Maas doesn't just tell her readers this, she shows us through character actions. We see it through Feyre's realization of what Rhysand's been telling her, and how he treats her vs how Tamlin treats her. Tamlin's fall from grace is that he didn't respect Feyre enough to allow her to be herself. He didn't treat her like an equal, but instead wanted keep her locked up and in his possession. I may have got the 'why' in that, but I didn't agree with it at all. The contrast between how Rhysand and Tamlin both treated Feyre was painfully obvious through out the book.Maas has a way with creating in-depth characters I really come to care about. She effortlessly brings them to life, as well as their stories, and vividly detailed worlds. I loved getting to go deeper into the Fey world, being introduced to more characters, and seeing the different parts of their world. I loved getting to know the Night Court. Maas has always created characters that really add depth to the story, and the Night Court was no different. I loved meeting and getting to know Rhys's inner circle. These characters weren't only friends, they are family, and it really showed in their story. Along with the Night Court, which has become my favorite court, I loved seeing more of the other characters, and learning about their histories, and ties together with their courts. I felt every range of emotion possible while reading this book. I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I swooned, got swept off my feet, was happy, angry (at a certain someone), and I completely fell in love with all that this book offered me. I officially have a book hang over. Sarah J. Maas what have you done to me?! The turn of events, the character developments, and the over all story are that good! I feel bad for the next book I read after this one, because I already had to re-read this book once, because it was so good. I don't even know what else I can say, other than, that is one heck of an awesome sequel! Now the torture will be waiting a whole another for the next book!*There are sensual scenes, and well written sex scenes through out the book, as well as the use of the f-word a few times through out the book, making it a book that may not be suitable for younger YA readers.",TRUE,26-05-2016,"Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2016",1635575583

So we can better make the thousands of choices that might ultimately lead to our own great work.‚Äù‚ÄúWe're all different, and we are all imperfect, and the imperfections are what makes each of us and our work interesting.‚Äù‚ÄúDistraction is not procrastination. Procrastination consistently undermines our ability to make things. Distraction is a strategy and service of the work.‚Äù‚ÄúYou are never alone when you're making art. You are in a constant dialogue with what is an what was.‚Äù‚ÄúIf we are aiming to create works that are exceptional, most rules don't apply. Average is nothing to aspire to.‚Äù‚ÄúIf inspiration does not come to lead the way, we show up anyway.‚Äù",TRUE,02-11-2023,"Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2023",593652886
651,The Creative Act: A Way of Being,"Helpful advice from a trusted ""source""",Mr. Richard Compton,4,"Wanted to recommend Rick Rubin‚Äôs book The Creative Act: A Way of Being to all my artist friends out there looking for some fresh inspiration or even a gift for younger artists just starting out.What has fascinated me about Rick Rubin is how he has had so much success as a record producer, but with such diverse array of iconic musical artists, such as The Beastie Boys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Johnny Cash, Tom Petty, and the Avett Brothers. All artists I greatly admire for their authenticity. That there must be something very fundamentally sound in his approach and methods.Recently I have been seeing a lot of interesting videos of Rubin talking about creativity on Tik Tok and YouTube and thought ‚Äúthe book is better‚Äù might apply here. And it is. It reminds me of a modern-day version of Robert Henri‚Äôs The Art Spirit.What I personally wanted to learn more about was Rubin‚Äôs involvement with Tom Petty‚Äôs Wildflowers album. Which I view as Tom Petty‚Äôs artistic peak. Considering that Tom Petty started writing songs in 1967 and Wildflowers was made 27 years later, for a late bloomer guy like me, this is very important knowledge to have. : )But Rubin never actually talks specifically about any of the artists he has worked with. He gives a lot of practical advice on how to break out of creative ruts and how to collaborate. Lots of pearls of wisdom on the whole creative process of selecting and nurturing seeds of ideas, crafting them into works of art, and then deciding when it is time to release them into the world, move ahead and start anew.He does however speak about the artist‚Äôs muse. He calls it Source. The short version is that Source is a never-ending cycle of metaphysical energy, a river-like current that ebbs and flows very much like the seasons of the earth. Human beings channel this energy into art as it is destined to be created by those ready to receive it. And art is life, because it is a manifestation of the way humans think and feel about life. As long as there is life, there will be art.There is a lot written in this book about self-awareness and being in harmony with the world. Maybe it is Rubin who learned from Petty? That Tom Petty just instinctively knew that he would never run out of ideas or things to create as long as he knew how to tune in to the ‚ÄúSource‚Äù.Because, and be warned, that there are also lots of phrases like ‚ÄúWe are dealing in a magic realm. Nobody knows why or how it works.‚Äù And ‚ÄúThe best work is the work you are excited about.‚Äù Which are true, if not obvious, and a bit annoying if not for so many of them. Because they end up sounding like empty platitudes and salesmen-ship.The book is also over 300 pages. And many a blank space at the end of each chapter to perhaps write notes. A cynic would look at the page inflation as a marketing ploy or ego inflation, or maybe even a little of both.Overall, the book is of value to those who create. It‚Äôs well written. It‚Äôs as if a wise person, a trusted source‚Äîso to speak‚Äîis talking directly to you, coaching you up in their gentle, but very specific, manner. I love that.",TRUE,19-08-2023,"Reviewed in the United States August 19, 2023",593652886
652,The Creative Act: A Way of Being,Stupid logical. Great reminder.

But that is far from a bad thing‚Ä¶If you‚Äôre looking for a distilled and potent reminder of what it is to ‚Äúlive and breathe the creative life‚Äù, this book is for you.As a film director, artist, and creative director‚Ä¶ I typically read heavily dense books on this kind of subject matter‚Ä¶ This is just a breath of fresh air (not unlike David Lynch‚Äôs ‚ÄúCatching the Big Fish‚Äù, which I HIGHLY recommend).I read this book front to back in a few lazy days. It‚Äôs an easy read, no doubt. But it‚Äôs also an amazingly great reminder of everything the creative mind must retain on a daily basis. After i read through it once, my hopes, desires, and passion were rekindled.Then, if you‚Äôre anything like me, every once in a while you‚Äôll open it up to any page - at random - and be reminded of a snippet of inspiration and advice that does nothing more (and nothing less) than remind you of the importance of curiosity and connection with the world around you.A must have.

If you are an artist, you will resonate with it in full and feeling the sense of belonging, to appreciate all the gift inside you, even no one will see or agree with what you see, what you feel.

He's an idealist who deals mostly in the emotional approach. While I like the simplicity and straightforwardness of it, I prefer realism and logic. But still, I am impressed by his approach and his method. I also like the non-traditional format of his book. The formatting choices were borderline esoteric, and that's nice to see. Most mainstream publishers, or even mid-level publishers, would have never allowed that book to go to print without heavy editing. But then, who is not going to give Rick Rubin what he wants.

657,The Creative Act: A Way of Being,The most important question it asks is: Why make art? The answer: To connect.,Cody Allen,5,"This book was a wonderful treatise on what it means to be and live as an artist. It is comprised of short chapters, each more a musing than anything certain. As a self-proclaimed artist, many of the ideas proposed were things I had considered before, but they were still refreshing to hear from a living artistic legend like Rick Rubin (co-founder of Def Jam records and winner of eight Grammy awards). As he writes, ‚Äúartists allow us to see what we are unable to see, but somehow already know.‚Äù This is how I felt reading his book!Many of my friends who work traditional jobs, ones with a start time and an end time, sometimes ask me when my weekend is. The thing is, artists don‚Äôt really take ‚Äòtime off.‚Äô Do we go on vacation? Sure. But we never turn ourselves off from drinking in what life has to offer, for who knows when that next seed of an idea will present itself, one that we must surely plant and nurture. It is the artist‚Äôs job to always remain open and ready to receive these seeds.How do we know when a work is finished? Of course, there is no ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô answer, it is more of a feeling. We work until it is done; sometimes a project requires long grueling hours and sometimes creating is a short and pleasant endeavor. Regardless what medium of art we are crafting in, ‚Äúthe amount of time we put in and the results we get are rarely in balance. A large movement may materialize all at once; other times a tiny detail may take days. And there‚Äôs no predicting how much of a role either will play in the final outcome.‚Äù As someone who has written music for over a decade, I can attest that this is true.One of the hardest aspects of being an artist is feeling successful. What happens when we publish a book, but fail to get anybody to read it? Or film a movie that nobody watches, or produce a song that nobody hears? Luckily, Rubin has an answer for this quandary of the soul as well, reminding us that ‚Äúsuccess has nothing to do with variables outside yourself.‚Äù Once we have finished with our current work, and are ready to release it to the world, we are successful. It is something that ‚Äúoccurs in the privacy of the soul.‚ÄùFrom finding ideas, crafting them, editing them, believing in them, releasing them, getting feedback, all the way to starting again, Rubin‚Äôs book touches on every aspect of living the creative life. It is full of wisdom that I will surely revisit in times of need.The most important question it asks is: Why make art?The answer: To connect.",TRUE,05-07-2023,"Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2023",593652886

690,Demon Copperhead: A Pulitzer Prize Winner,"I Found Myself Challenged, and Yes, Strangely Blessed",Stephanie McCall,4,"Demon Copperhead. Holy moley, what a book. It's one of those books I made myself put down just because I didn't want to finish it too soon. At the same time, it's one I probably wouldn't have read at all, except that a friend recommended it, based on the fact that one of my own writing projects is dealing with some of the same themes. That, plus its connection to David Copperfield and the almost lyrical prose of the free sample chapters, convinced me to pay the exorbitant-for-Kindle price of the whole book.Well, I'm glad I did. Demon Copperhead is one of those books that gets in your head and stays stuck there until you finish and even afterward. Your pages turn a mile a minute because not only do you want the characters to be okay, you want to know what happens. You want to see Demon and his compatriots either triumph over their hardships or, if they choose a path that won't end there, at least get to an ending that makes sense and leaves a logical and lasting impression. Which in both cases, oh boy, do they. These characters don't just feel like real people, they are real. I know I say that a lot, but man! I was not one of them; I was your classic straight-A, straight edge student who went home to stable parents every night. But I knew these kids existed. I lived (still live) in a town with problems and stories similar to Lee County's. I didn't have the same problems or story as Demon, but straight A's and straight edge or not, I had my own reasons for being, let's say, in the ""orphan class"" of my circle. Like Demon, I spent a lot of years feeling like I had a lot of shine, but if it came off, people would see coal underneath and be repulsed.Beyond that, Barbara Kingsolver just plain nailed these characters, these settings, this life story of her modern, Appalachian David Copperfield. I not only felt for, but felt with and not only traveled with, but traveled inside, Demon all the way from his home next door to the Peggott's, to Creaky's farm, to the McCobb's, to Coach Winfield's and everywhere in between. I can't say every place and character was one I grew to love. I mean, come on, some of these people are downright cruel or downright creeps. But, they were three-dimensional and I could at least understand them. And even the situations and scenes at which I cringed, left an impression on me. Special mention goes to:-The Squadron at Creaky Farm. Every kid needs a friend like Tommy, I don't care who or how old you are. And as dysfunctional as the Squadron was, I got behind the brotherhood. I've written situations and characters like that, not as well as Barbara has, I'll grant you. The commitment to survival, the heart, the unbroken spirits, will do something to you.-Demon's developing drawing talent and cartoons. I loved seeing those, from his first superhero drawings all the way up to the Red Neck comic strip. I kept thinking, how would he draw me? And I loved how Barbara gave this resilient, rough-edged character an artistic, soft side without making him a stereotypical beta male or heaven forbid, what folks in Appalachia might think of as a sissy.-Mr. Armstrong and Ms. Annie, of course. Not just because they're ""good teachers trying to save the poor foster kid,"" either, which I've seen done and done poorly. No, you get the sense they're learning and growing right alongside Demon, making their own mistakes and learning how to save up and give away their own juice. Plus, I absolutely loved Mr. Armstrong's way of showing his students their history and how it has contributed to their current poverty, educational lack, drug-related temptations, ""and etc.""-Angus Winfield, oh my gosh, I just love her to bits. She is the coolest and least stereotypical high school student you'd ever want to meet. If we were in high school together, we might've blown each other off, but I'd like to think we could've been friends. Maybe we would've reluctantly partnered for one of those stupid Antarctica projects and laughed over the fact that Bettina Cook thought penguins lived with Santa at the North Pole.Aside from settings and characters, Barbara also nailed her themes. As mentioned, the one that sticks with me the most is the history, present situation, and future outlook for the kids of Appalachia, especially considering the current prescription drug situation. Now again, I was not one of those kids and am not one of those adults. But, having lived with cerebral palsy from birth, having gotten nothing but the runaround and the ""we give up, you're too 'high-functioning'"" from those who should've fallen all over themselves to help--yeah, I got Demon's frustrations, from a different place. It's no picnic when over 90% of your income comes from a government check--and that's *with* four-year college, Aunt June. So yeah, I was with Mr. Armstrong, and Ms. Annie, and Angus. Wake up, stupid school board, napping principal, whoever. Get off your butt and give these kids a future, even if it has to start with one little academic team. Wake up, medical system, one kid's overdosed mom oughta be enough to make you think, what's going on with these prescription drugs? Wake up, social services, what part of filthy farmhouse, slave labor, and flat broke family with four kids under seven don't you *get?*The other themes, especially resilience, jump off the page, too. I rooted for Demon the whole time because, as Mr. Armstrong says, he is the driver. He walked out of the major car wreck, not once, but many times. Sometimes I cringed at his naivete, as with the original David Copperfield, especially when it came to Emmy and particularly Dori (who I felt sorry for, but my Lord)! But pair that resilience with the darker side of the human condition, such as which lives get celebrated and which lives just get the casket lid closed on them, and it shines all the brighter.Several scenes ""popped"" all over the book, so many it would take too much time to enumerate them all. And some I can't tell you about without spoiling the ending, although the ending is that little bit of hope and happiness I hung on for. And you *do* have to hang on, through a lot. One reason I took a star is sheer length. This thing is a doorstop. Now, that's not a problem on its own. Barbara Kingsolver is kinda known for doorstops. But it doesn't work as well here as I've seen her work with it, because what you have with this book is Demon's entire, literal life story. For me personally, there were a few times where I asked myself, ""Do I really need all this?"" And there were times where Demon seemed to relive versions of the same kind of experience. I felt like, ""Okay, I've seen this once and it was powerful enough that I think we can move on.""I also took a star because, as much as I loved all these characters, sometimes they crowded the stage. Sometimes there'd be characters in a scene or an arc who I didn't think needed to be there. I completely understood Barbara's desire to make Lee County one of those places where you keep coming back and you keep running into people you knew and they in turn touch your life again. It happens, I should know. But truth is stranger than fiction, and in fiction, all these people popping in and out just cramps the book's style. Some characters, like Tommy and Fast Forward, it works for. Others it's like, ""Okay, move along.""Perhaps this is why I thought a few threads weren't developed at the pace they should've been. For instance, Fast Forward is a monster and I'm totally behind that. And you do see hints of his true character throughout the novel, like at Creaky Farm. But he's in and out of the story so much that the actual revelation of how deep Fast Forward's problems go--well, it works, but it also feels a bit out of left field. The same is true for Betsy's thread, in that yeah, I buy Demon having a grandma he doesn't meet until he's twelve, and I buy her not wanting to be in his life. But then, as Angus says, her desire to basically take over makes no sense.Finally, yes. I did take off points for language. That's not because I can't ""handle"" it. I'm an adult, for goodness' sakes. But the near-constant F-bombs just got on my nerves after a while because, just, really? And as you might know, the misuse of Jesus' name is a very personal pet peeve. Now, I'm sure Jesus Himself had to tell His disciples to clean up their language now and again, especially Peter. And it's my personal theory that our beloved St. Paul had a potty mouth, at least to a point. But it does wear on you. So, not a major issue for adult readers, but if it's not your thing, caveat emptor. And yeah, I'd say don't give this one to your teen, it's got some pretty heavy depictions of addiction in it, as well as a couple of sex scenes I freely admit I skimmed.All that aside though, I don't regret spending a minute with Demon Copperhead. He is a perfect modern David Copperfield, he got me thinking, and in a weird way, yeah, the book blessed me. It inspired me to keep writing. And I'm willing to bet it will stir something new and unique inside you, too. Mature readers, grab a copy and savor. There's redemption to be had if you're looking.",TRUE,10-02-2023,"Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2023",63251922
691,Demon Copperhead: A Pulitzer Prize Winner,A deeply truthful fiction,Dan'l Danehy-Oakes,5,"The similarity of this title to Dickens's _David Copperfield_ is no accident; though the books are very little alike, Kingsolver cheerfully admits that she owes Dickens for inspiration; the theme is much the same: institutionalized poverty, and the terrible effects it has on children in particular.Like his sort-of model, Demon -- his real name is Damon Fields, but almost everyone in this book goes by a nickname of one sort or another -- narrates his own tale, and begins with his birth: in the caul, as he says; the amniotic sac emerged, undamaged, with him in it, while his mother lay unconscious, from the chemicals in her bloodstream, on the floor of her single-wide. That he survived is due to her neighbor and landlady, Mrs. Peggot, who checked up on the mother on her way to church, ahe had her husband call an ambulance. No father's name appeared on Demon's birth certificate; mother knew who the father was, but he had drowned at a place called the Devil's Bathtub.This all takes place, I should say, in Lee County, in the south-western part of Virginia, Appalachian coal country. Demon's mom -- when she isn't on a bender or in rehab -- works at the local Wal-Mart, stocking seasonal items and telling customers where to find things. He himself grows up more or less wild, alongside his friend Maggot, Mrs. Peggot's grandson, who is with her because Maggot's mom is in prison for carving up her abusive boyfriend. Mr and Mrs Peggot do a lot to help Demon out, and they provide a sort of extended family for him.Demon's youth ends abruptly when Murrell ""Stoner"" Stoner arrives, woos the mother, and ultimately moves into the trailer. He is as abusive as Maggot's father, and at one point locks Demon into his room for multiple days. His behavior drives Mom back onto drugs -- she has been collecting chips for a while now. She turns up unconscious, and Demon (who by now has not eaten or been to the bathroom in several days) rides with her in the ambulance. DSS -- the local version of Child Protective Services -- comes along and ""places"" Demon at a farm/foster home run by Crickson, an old widower who works the boys hard tending the cattle and harvesting the tobacco.And, as you might expect, things go downhill from there. Eventually Demon has a brief period of happiness and glory, when, running away from another foster home (run by Mr and Mrs McCobb) he finds his paternal grandmother, Betsy Woodall. She and her chair-bound brother Dick see to it that Demon is placed in with Coach Winfield, who trains him up to play football. He quickly becomes a star in the high school football team, until a knee is very badly broken.This begins Demon's dependence on Oxycontin and other drugs, which, by now, have become a major theme of the book.Let's go no further with summary; let us rather consider the thematics of _Demon Copperhead_.As noted, Kingsolver explicitly states that her primary theme is the effects of institutionalized poverty, especially on children. Demon muses about the poverty trap at some length throughout the book. At one point, a teacher gives a short lecture on the ongoing war of the Haves on the Have-Nots. (My term, not his.) He goes into detail about how the coal company ruined the land economy of Lee County and ate up its men, until machines took over and most of the men were suddenly unemployed.The drug companies, and especially Purdue, named explicitly by June Peggott (another daughter of Mrs. Peggott), a nurse, who gives occasional lectures on how opioids, and especially Oxycontin, have further destroyed the folk of Lee County. One of the more hellish locales in _Demon Copperhead_ is a pain clinic run by a doctor who, for a fee of one sort or another, happily writes whatever prescription the patient asks for.One of Demon's friends, Tommy Waddell, brings in a third variation on the theme: he describes how American culture has made ""hillbillies"" a laughingstock, a living punchline, and a lesser class of human being, from _The Beverly Hillbillies_ and its kin, to _Deliverance_, and beyond. He and Demon (whom, I have not mentioned, is an extremely talented artist) create a comic strip about an Appalachian superhero, the Red Neck, and it runs weekly in the local newspaper (where Tommy, by this point, is working).It is pretty clear that one of the purposes of this book is to provide a counterweight to the ""hillbilly"" image, while staying true to the characters and communities it depicts. Lee County is real; the small towns named in the book are not; nor, of course, are the specific characters.Ursula K. Le Guin wrote that fiction writers tell the truth by lying. _Demon Copperfield_ tells a whole lot of powerful truth. In much the manner of Dickens, Kingsolver makes you care not only about Demon but about much of his supporting cast -- excepting the genuinely villainous ones like Stoner -- while recognizing their flaws.This is, in short, one incredible book.",TRUE,19-08-2023,"Reviewed in the United States August 19, 2023",63251922
692,Demon Copperhead: A Pulitzer Prize Winner,More than a Dickens rewrite,Jay Ruud,5,"When, at the age of 15, I first read David Copperfield, Charles Dickens‚Äô classic novel of the protagonist‚Äôs struggle to rise above child poverty in a society seemingly structured to keep him poor, it was the first book that made me tear up at the end, that glorious end with the angelic Agnes ever ‚Äúpointing upward.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure that Barbara Kingsolver‚Äôs DemonCopperhead could possibly elicit anything like that response from my jaded, seen-it-all-before, read-it-all-before consciousness. Re-imagining the quintessentially British Dickens‚Äô nineteenth-century story as a twenty-first century slice of American Appalachian life? How‚Äôs that likely to work?Well, of course, it was likely to bomb spectacularly. But instead, what I found from the book‚Äôs very first paragraph was a voice that explodes off the page with both confidence and world-weariness, with stoicism and self-knowledge, with everything the character is going to exhibit in the rest of this blockbuster of a novel.Dickens‚Äô David famously opens with, ‚ÄúWhether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.‚Äù By contrast, Kingsolver‚Äôs Copperhead (whose real name is Damon Fields, but he has red hair, so‚Ä¶) opens with, ‚ÄúFirst, I got myself born. A decent crowd was on hand to watch and they‚Äôve always given me that much: the worst of the job was up to me, my mother being let‚Äôs just say out of it.‚ÄùIn this life, you make your own choices, and if you‚Äôre going to get anywhere, and your mother is in and out of rehab constantly, you have to do it yourself, Damon tells you at the beginning. You think there‚Äôs going to be a hero in your life? Think again. There‚Äôs just you, trying to make your way in a world that‚Äôs stacked against you. Here‚Äôs a voice that, in its tone of genuine down-home rural Americanism sounds a lot more like Huck Finn than anybody in Dickens. Like Huck, he has a memorable way of putting things in his colorful American vernacular: He‚Äôs ‚Äúthe Eagle Scout of trailer trash,‚Äù he tells us at one point.And I don‚Äôt mean to say that you must be familiar with David Copperfield to enjoy Demon Copperhead. You can follow the plot, empathize with the characters and absorb the themes of Kingsolver‚Äôs book without ever having heard of Dickens. But it does add something to the overall experience of the book if you know the Copperfield story. In particular, there‚Äôs a bit of fun for readers when they can recognize by name a Kingsolvian character intended to parallel a Dickensian one. Thus, when Damon‚Äôs abusive stepfather bears the name of ‚ÄúStoner,‚Äù it‚Äôs easy to see the connection with David‚Äôs equally cruel stepfather, whose name happens to be ‚ÄúMurdstone.‚Äù Damon‚Äôs kind neighbors, the Peggots, clearly recall David‚Äôs friends the Peggottys and Clara Peggoty, David‚Äôs early nurse and lifelong friend. Dickens‚Äô charming and narcissistic James Steerforth, who for a while promises to be that ‚Äúhero of my own life‚Äù David looks forward to in his opening sentence, finds his counterpoint in Kingsolver‚Äôs Sterling Ford, nicknamed Fast Forward, star quarterback on the high school football team and, for awhile, Damon‚Äôs idol. Copperfield‚Äôs ‚Äúchild wife‚Äù Dora Spenlowe is echoed in Kingsolver‚Äôs Dori, and when Damon falls for his needy, childish Dori you don‚Äôt have to remember David Copperfield to know that relationship is going to be a disaster, but it helps.Occasionally Kingsolver‚Äôs parallel characters are direct mirror images of Dickens‚Äô, as in the case of Damon‚Äôs grandmother Betsy and her eccentric friend Mr. Dick, who liked flying kites, mirroring David‚Äôs great-aunt Betsy and her eccentric friend Mr. Dick who also liked flying kites. Sometimes there‚Äôs more of a difference: Damon‚Äôs short-term foster father Mr. McCobb has a few things in common with David‚Äôs Mr. Micawber, lack of steady employment and perpetual new schemes to get rich among them, but Micawber is a well-meaning screwup, while McCobb is just trying to take advantage of the system. And Dickens‚Äô Uriah Heep is a far more insidious villain than Kingsolver‚Äôs assistant coach U-Haul Pyles, whose downfall is far less precipitous than Heep‚Äôs in Dickens. And then there is ‚ÄúAngus‚Äù Winfield, daughter of the high school football coach and Damon‚Äôs foster-sister during the best and worst years of his life, who clearly parallels David‚Äôs guardian angel, Agnes Wickfield, and who you know from the first is going to be a major influence in Damon‚Äôs life.Of course, knowing Dickens gives you an idea of the role these characters are going to play in the story. But the plot of Demon Copperhead is not therefore predictable, as Kingsolver translates these characters‚Äô motivations and effects on the protagonist into a completely different milieu of time and place. Ultimately, what‚Äôs important about the influence of Dickens on Kingsolver‚Äôs book is not the superficial correspondences of plot or character, but rather their very significant agreement in terms of theme and authorial intent. In an afterword to her novel, Kingsolver writes, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful to Charles Dickens for writing David Copperfield, his impassioned critique of institutional poverty and its damaging effects on children in his society. Those problems are still with us. In adapting his novel to my own place and time, working for years with his outrage, inventiveness, and empathy at my elbow, I‚Äôve come to think of him as my genius friend.‚ÄùIt is precisely those social evils that Kingsolver has directly in her sites in this novel: The institutional poverty of former coal-mining areas of her native Appalachia; the effects of that poverty on children, especially children whose parents have been victims of that poverty and are dead or imprisoned. She attacks the ineptitude and bureaucracy of child welfare services, the abuse of the system of foster care that allows people like Damon‚Äôs foster parents to take children solely for the sake of taking the monthly support money, or for gaining slave labor like the tobacco farmer who first fosters Damon. She attacks a justice system that will accept the testimony of an abusive stepfather rather than the word of the abused child.But more than anything else she attacks the opioid crisis. Damon, who has a brief period when it seems he may escape the cesspool of his luckless life through success on the gridiron as a high school football star, has a terrible knee injury for which he is prescribed opioid pain relievers to which he becomes hopelessly addicted, and Kingsolver‚Äôs indictment of the doctors, salesmen, druggists, and especially the Sackler-owned Purdue Pharma are is merciless in the novel. It truly seems like there is no way out for Damon‚Äîbut as David Copperfield had a talent in writing that finally helped pull him out of poverty, the fact that Damon has a talent for drawing‚Äîall he has left after football‚Äîdoes give him a ray of hope. I won‚Äôt spoil the end by telling you whether he‚Äôs able to use it.Thus Kingsolver is not simply the heir of Dickens in recasting his most personal novel; she is more importantly the spiritual heir of Dickens‚Äô novel of social criticism, something you don‚Äôt see much of any more. Where is Dickens today? Where are the Zolas? The Sinclair Lewises? The John Steinbecks? Gone. But we‚Äôve still got Barbara Kingsolver.",TRUE,20-03-2023,"Reviewed in the United States March 20, 2023",63251922
693,Demon Copperhead: A Pulitzer Prize Winner,Heartbreaking story,Linda S Moore,5,This was my first Barbara Kingsolver book and my third Audio. This was by far the best book. The audio was perfect. The Narrator did such a great job you could feel every little thing.This book is about a boy. A boy and his life's ups and downs. Mostly downs but a few ups in there. Set in the Appalachians. In a trailer. Born to a teenage mother. This kid really started out at the bottom of the chain. It holds your attention all the way to the soft sweet ending. What all this child goes through is heartbreaking and very realistic.The author did such a good job of describing the events in this novel. Each thing that happened to Demon Copperhead made you stop and take a long look at life. At how things can happened exactly as told. How in some instances things are just out of our control. Things that some people look down on others for having no idea it could happen to them or one of their loved ones. I think in some of the things I heard in this book happen in all families in some way or the other. It's devastating and so sad to think of but also very realistic. Demon has so many losses in his young life. To say that he made his choices is unrealistic. You would have to take a walk in his shoes to see that maybe.I am so glad I listened to the audio version of this book. The narrator takes you through so much and his use of voices in places makes it feel like more than just a book. He told a story here. A story that everyone should read.

711,Remarkably Bright Creatures: A Read with Jenna Pick,A Wonderful Start!,Whitney Moore,4,"I am besotted with the octopus. Besotted! This first-time novelist presents a marvelously erudite creature narrating how much he KNOWS, and I must confess that his knowing(s) really melted my heart -- like my dog does, always devotedly attending and perfectly, albeit without a word. For me, this story amplifies my wonder at how seamlessly non-human nature can communicate with us, offering incredible kinds of conversation ‚Äì even from inside a tank at a marine-life aquarium.Marcellus the Octopus is always ruminating about what he hears from people passing through the tank exhibits, saying things like ‚ÄúIgnorance is bliss.‚Äù To this particular expression, Marcellus objects because, he says, ""Here, in the kingdom of animals, ignorance is dangerous. The poor herring dropped into the tank lacks any awareness of the shark lurking below. Ask the herring whether what he doesn‚Äôt know can hurt him.‚Äù This contemplation becomes compassion when the octopus notes that ‚ÄúHumans can be wounded by their own oblivion, too. They do not see it, but I do. It happens all the time. Humans walk alike (or, in this case, unalike) far more than they realize.‚ÄùThe human characters in this aquarium couldn‚Äôt see what Marcellus could ‚Äì- until they could, thanks largely to assistance from a literal sucker for injured creatures; creatures like himself; creatures captured in the ticking of time with lifespans that are getting shorter every day.Spoiler alert: they all get freed in the end.",TRUE,30-09-2023,"Reviewed in the United States September 30, 2023",63204150

While the portrayal of the octopus seems beyond what he could possibly see and do, it forced me to do some research about the ability of giant octopi to accomplish some of the things that Marcellus did--yes, there are examples of these creatures accomplishing what he does. (Obviously, no one actually can verify what they think, but these creatures have been observed doing many of the things that he does in the book.) The best part of the way the book is written is that all of the characters are developed well and their lives, while they seem to be totally separate one not truly influencing the others, are slowly intertwined as the book continues.Obviously, I loved the book and found it hard to put down. I called one of my daughters to tell them that I had a wonderful suggestion for her next read. (She is a working mother with 3 kids who keep her busy a lot of the time.) She told me she had one for me also: it turned out that she recommended Remarkably Bright Creatures to me just as I was about to do the same to her.

713,Remarkably Bright Creatures: A Read with Jenna Pick,Best of the Year,Anthony Conty,5,"‚ÄúRemarkably Bright Creatures‚Äù by Shelby Van Pelt starts with an animal as a main character, and if you have seen ‚ÄúThe Shape of Water,‚Äù your first fear is a recreation of that quirky top twist. We alternate chapters between Tova, an aquarium custodian, and an octopus. Because we accept this as a work of fiction, we go along, despite our doubts, about which aquarium dwellers would have the best mind for crime-solving and why Van Pelt chose the eight-legged one.Cameron, a third character, has a bad breakup and loses his job. Now, we have three lives that need to intersect, and it does not take long for you to care about them. Tova‚Äôs misanthropic characteristics somehow make her more intriguing. The incident when all three of these remarkably different characters come together happens early in the novel but still qualifies as an ‚Äúa-ha‚Äù moment. Each is a bright creature in its way, and they will surprise you.An octopus as an omniscient narrator sounds like a hokey idea, but Van Pelt makes it work. As the winner of BookBrowse‚Äôs Best Debut, it is unique and not surprisingly like nothing you have read. Van Pelt most likely has a few more stories in her. I read a few reviews that stated how horrible of a human being Cameron is, but that shows you how skilled Van Pelt is. Loveable idiots are hard to produce, so I credit the author. She also creates chapter titles that mean nothing until you read, a tactic that works like the ‚ÄúFrasier‚Äù TV show.Predicting endings or twists is not my skill set, but I saw this coming. It did not take away from my enjoyment since the characters meant so much to me then. How would the average person respond in the face of so much loss? Tova leads the novel as a woman who goes about her business in life because what else can she do? Marcellus, the Giant Pacific Octopus, has the advantage of knowing everything as a literary device in which we see the tragedy behind the character‚Äôs ignorance.It is too early to predict that this will be the best of the year, and I cannot see anything passing up this and ‚ÄúIn Love.‚Äù The story arc travels at the right pace, and I did not want to put it down. All three main characters had nothing in common with me, but I still related to them. When everything starts coming together and you see the finish line, you cannot help but feel relief and pity simultaneously.

720,Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7),"An Important Part of My Childhood, Which I Still Love Over 15 Years Later",Lewis D. Medeiros,5,"I've been a fan of Harry Potter since about the grade school, back when the only books that had been published yet were the first three, when Potter's popularity was still on the rise, when Christian fundamentalists were still catching on to the horrifying idea that a ""witchcraft"" story was gaining popularity with children, and grade-school teachers were similarly catching on to Harry Potter being a pretty effective tool for getting kids to develop a liking for books. Indeed, that was how I discovered them: my English teacher somewhere in the 6th-to-8th-grade portion of schooling (where my Catholic school shifted to a high-school-like classroom and teacher shuffle to prepare students for the routines public school would involve) introduced me and several other students who were showing less interest and enthusiasm in the class to the Harry Potter novels, actually lending us her own copies of the first three books to get us reading. By the time the much thicker fourth volume, Goblet of Fire, came out, I was so in love in the series that its intimidating size was far more appealing to me than intimidating, like a larger bowl of rocky road ice cream might look appealing.In the decade-and-a-half since, I've never let go of my love of Harry Potter, even if I have gone long stretches of time without keeping an active eye on the franchise. The recent revival of widespread Potter interest of the appealing-but-flawed sequel stage play (""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"") and an arguably-more-interesting-and consistently-engrossing prequel-sidestory-movie (""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"") has prompted me to revisit the book series yet again, as well as replace my old worn-down hardcover copies with both the paperback box set and the eBook downloads from Pottermore's e-shop ‚Äî which are cross-compatible with Kindle accounts and can be transferred over as identical files to the Kindle versions, by the way, even though Amazon doesn't count those files as purchases of the Kindle eBooks, but rather as separate account-exclusive items. Having checked on Audible, this series does not seem to be compatible with Whispersync for Voice no matter where you buy the eBooks as of yet, so audiobook fans who like to read the text while listening may wish to take note of that when deciding whether to buy a physical or eBook versions (this is possibly due to revisions having been made to the text for series consistency in the time since the audiobooks were recorded).In-depth reviews of the individual books are perhaps best saved for each book's individual page on Amazon, so I will give only a broad-stroke review of the stories here ‚Äî if you are considering buying the series as a complete box set, it's likely you've already read and enjoyed at least the one of the books. But for the uninitiated, Harry Potter is a series that follows a boy, Harry himself, across a seven-year series of adventures culminating in the return and subsequent war against Lord Voldemort, a terrible Dark wizard who wreaked horrors upon the magical and non-magical communities alike until his unexpected and inexplicable destruction when he killed Harry's parents and then attempted to kill Harry while he was still an infant. Harry, growing up with his non-magical (""Muggle"") aunt and uncle, who cruelly neglect and emotionally abuse him, receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when he turns eleven, whereupon he discovers that not only is there a burgeoning community of witches and wizards living and hiding in plain sight in a seemingly-ordinary 1990s British society, but that he is famous among the magical community. They call him the ""Boy Who Lived,"" the cause of Voldemort's disappearance and the end of his reign of terror. But as Harry enters the magical world and begins to learn about this new side of his life and the wonders of magic, he gets drawn into a series of perilous events that lead him closer and closer to his eventual destiny with each passing book, gradually revealing more of the truth behind what happened on the night Harry's parents were murdered and what led to it, among other things.Harry Potter is a fantastic series. One might be tempted to think it's overblown or over-rated by its enthusiasts. One would, in fact, be forgiven for taking that impression almost exclusively from the movies; they're enjoyable enough in their own right, but suffer problems of less-than-amazing adaptation and fluctuations in creative vision that make the film series feel somewhat disjointed and less-thoughtful than the books they're based on, and have the added problem of the younger actors and actresses often taking a few films to develop the skills to portray their characters naturally (an occupational hazard of a fantasy epic that relies on child actors, really). The Harry Potter novels, meanwhile, provide an arguably smoother introduction and, subsequently, a more fleshed-out experience in Harry's world, with the earlier, shorter books providing a comfortable and more ""episodic"" early portion that's great for allowing readers to get their feet wet, becoming gradually more involved and complex until the build-up culminates with the fourth and fifth novels, where the story goes all-in on characterization and worldbuilding detail, presuming the writer to be fully invested by that point, and keeping that level of maturity and intensity right up to the ending of the final volume.It would be remiss of me to call this series perfect, don't mistake the five-star rating for that. J.K. Rowling certainly has her weaknesses as a writer, and it could be accurately said that the novels suffer from a bit of a bloating problem that surfaced around Book Five, where Rowling clearly had more power to say ""no"" to her editors (incidentally, this is also the point at which the American text just gives up at hiding away a lot of the Britishisms in narration and dialogue, and I will say the books are at least better for that much). This is a clear Your Mileage May Vary kind of point. I personally enjoy the tangential worldbuilding that comes out of it, and consider it worth whatever ""bloat"" occurs as a result. But then, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite of the seven novels, and even for some avowed fans of Harry Potter, that book was too long and spent a little too much time on certain things. There's really no way to tell whether that will be a problem for you until you get there and either like it or don't like it. But what problems the Potter novels have are, in the grand scheme, just niggles. It all comes together in a really great way and in spite of the flaws, it's a really great series of books worthy of the classification of ""epic.""But one thing that might surprise people unfamiliar with Potter is that this is not a fantasy action-adventure series. It's more of a mystery series coated in a gooey chocolate fantasy syrup. Harry Potter himself tends to fill the role of a combination Frodo Baggins figure and up-and-coming detective character, and the most important plot points are, regardless of who figures out or explains a given part of things, presented as mysteries. Action sequences occur and can be quite intense, particularly in later volumes, but this is not the story of a big, super-cool hero slaying dragons; it's a story of circumstance, figuring out the circumstance, and then reacting to the circumstance. Some readers seem annoyed by the fact that eleven-year-old Harry never matures in this series to a point where by the end of magical high school he's capable of going head-to-head in a duel with a Dark Lord with decades of extensive magical knowledge under his belt, but that is simply not the angle that this series goes for. My comparison of Harry to Frodo Baggins was not an idle-name-drop. Harry's role in this story is very deliberately that of the hero who stands strong against adversity but ultimately triumphs through low-key action behind the scenes of a conflict in which number other, more powerful or more experienced combatants command the bulk of the Dark Lord's attention. And, like Frodo (and his progenitor, Bilbo), sometimes Harry is helped by sheer circumstance, the timely and skillful intervention of one of his friends, or a combination of his own efforts plus those things. The series does give us a fairly clear picture of what an action-centric lead character in this universe might look like, and I think that's where a fair portion of reader disappointment with Harry's more subdued take on heroics comes from, but he is an eleven-year-old who eventually becomes a seventeen-year-old over the course of the story, contending with a villain who has fifty-plus-year lead on experience over him. I think I would have raised an eyebrow had Harry ever bested Voldemort in a straight-up magical fight.As with everything, this series is something you should read for yourself if you're unsure. There's probably a copy available at your local library if you don't live in a particularly strict area with a stick up its rear about fantasy novels with magic in them. I recommend giving them a shot, and if Book One doesn't jive with you at first, sticking with it at least until the end of Book Two. This is a series that improves as it moves forward, each book adding new layers to the existing world by pacing its narrative in the same way a child might learn more and more about the real world as he or she grows into an adult, which is a large part of Harry Potter's effectiveness as a coming-of-age story. The reader, in a figurative sense, grows with Harry, as many of the original readers grew with Harry alongside the release of each subsequent book. This is as much a narrative tool as a consequence of readers aging as they read the books, because with very rare exceptions scattered through the series, the narrative is locked firmly into whatever it is that Harry Potter himself is seeing, hearing, saying, feeling, or thinking, and the reader's understanding of events and the world around him is often limited to what he knows or notices at any given time.As for the separate editions of these books. I can't voice for the ""Complete Collection"" eBook specifically, since I bought the eBooks individually on Pottermore, but assuming the formatting for the Complete Collection is identical, then the digital set relevant to this review is well-put-together and smoothly formatted, just about the best way you'll ever experience Harry Potter digitally without buying the iBooks-and-iOS-exclusive Enhanced Edition eBooks available on Pottermore, which feature animated illustrations and the like. If you have an iPad or iPhone, that is the edition I recommend for digital consumption, but for standard Kindle and Android users, or people who like reading eBooks on PC, this collection and its individual-eBook versions aren't inferior to physical books in any sense other than not having a special font for chapter headings; the U.S. editions of the eBooks even contain the iconic chapter title illustrations, although not the original American cover art (the minimalist cover art of the eBooks makes for a smoother transition between colored screens and black-and-white e-readers, though).The hardcover collection is one that I can't vouch for as a set, but having owned and read through the series in hardcover in the past, what I can vouch for is that the American hardcover editions are very nice to own. The box set for Hardcover may lack the text revision of the eBooks and more recent paperback printings, however, and while the chapter artwork and font for titles is something I prefer over the U.K. editions, it should be acknowledged that the American hardcovers are of a slightly cheaper construction than the U.K. editions, although also, paradoxically, they have a higher page count due to Scholastic's formatting choices (there are fewer words per page compared to the U.K. versions, and Order of the Phoenix has the formatting oddity of being the only book in the series with narrower margins and line-spacing, due to its much higher word count). Having researched this set, it should be acknowledged that the ""trunk"" is made of cardboard, so don't expect, you know, an extremely durable box or anything. It's just a stylized container for a box set.As for the paperback box set, the purchase that prompted this review? It's fantastic. The American version with the characters riding a dragon, specifically: I'm seeing a lot of user pictures in this review second for completely different sets, and it seems there's a motley assortment of mixed sets in the marketplace listings, too. The box itself is quite sturdy and adorned with beautiful artwork by the cover illustrator, Mary GrandPr√©, depicting a scene from later in the series that puts me in the mind of the old R.A. Salvatore ""Cleric Quintet"" omnibus cover art (which features a similar scene by what I assume is coincidence). The paperback volumes themselves are of a nice quality that makes them both more durable and less stiff-feeling than some smaller, cheaper mass-market paperbacks, and they even feature raised lettering for the front cover titling, although the paper and print quality are noticeably lesser than the hardcover editions, feeling at a casual touch like the pages would be easier to damage both by bending and by splashing a few drops of a drink in the book's general direction, not up to the quality of some of the better-made paperback novels that I own. Even so, these are paperbacks that should be taken care of and kept for posterity rather than tossed about like a cheapy grocery store throwaway novel that you picked up on a whim during a food-shopping trip, though the thickness of books four through seven may make it difficult to avoid bending the spines.Having checked certain passages in the books, I can also confirm that the paperback boxed set, bought new, should contained the revised editions of the text, as well, for as minor as those changes are to the overall experience (again, they're really just consistency tweaks).",TRUE,04-12-2016,"Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2016",545162076

723,Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7),"Loved the stories, but now I'm suffering Potter withdrawal.",Honest Reviewer,5,"- Harry Potter and the Philosopher‚Äôs StoneI had to research a few Briticisms throughout this book, but they didn't seriously interrupt the story flow. What did interrupt were the numerous comma splices. They forced me to re-read many sentences. Having said that, I enjoyed the plot and character development. I never felt bored.If Amazon had half stars, I'd give Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone 4 1/2. Since that isn't possible, I'll award it a 4.- Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsMystery, humor‚Äîand a smidgeon of possible romance?The plusses: Rowling steers Harry Potter through a mystery with a surprise outcome, sprinkling the tale with tidbits of humor. When I reached the end, I wanted to keep reading and find out how Harry spent his summer with his horrible relatives.Minuses: Numerous comma splices drew me out of the story, forcing me to re-read sentences.A solid 4.5 out of 5 stars. I‚Äôd award an extra .5 stars if it weren‚Äôt for the comma splices.- Harry Potter and the Prisoner of AzkabanTwists, turns, and surprises.I enjoyed this most of the first three books in the Harry Potter series. Rowling steers readers through suspenseful mini mysteries throughout the novel. Astute readers might be able to spot clues that will help them see what happens next. Hint: Pay attention to every detail. The old characters make appearances, as well as a few new ones, including an unexpected friend for Harry.As usual, I enjoyed the ending and can‚Äôt wait to read the next in the series.Rowling‚Äôs comma splices occur far less frequently in this book, which increased my reading enjoyment immensely. I can‚Äôt resist‚Äîfive stars.- Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireThe best yet, with intrigue, laughs, and tears.This book reads like a spy novel. I couldn‚Äôt decipher the good guys and the bad guys, and just when I decided someone was one or the other, I discovered I was wrong. Rowling finally reveals how to pronounce ‚ÄúHermione‚Äù (Her-my-oh-nee) due to a clever conversation where Hermione teaches Krum how to say her name properly.Near the end, one of the characters explains how and why many past events occurred. I found it a tad like an infodump. Run-on sentences occur far less in Goblet than in Prisoner, and mostly in dialogue, which assists comprehension.Now, I wonder how Harry‚Äôs summer with the Dursleys will go. His summers always intrigue and amuse me.Note to parents: One of the chapters (thirty-two, I believe) contains violent scenes that wouldn‚Äôt be suitable for young children.Another five-star read.- Harry Potter and the Order of the PhoenixWith every novel in the Harry Potter series, I find myself becoming more engaged and wanting to read ‚Äújust one more chapter‚Äù before closing my Kindle.In Phoenix, Harry‚Äôs character develops as he grows into a typical angst-ridden teenager‚Äîwith more reason for angst than most of his peers. Rowling increases the romance factor and introduces a character so vile that I disliked her from her first appearance in the novel. A couple of secrets are revealed, including the reason why Harry must spend summers with the Dursleys, and an intriguing clue surfaces that, I suspect, will play an important part in Half-Blood Prince.Rowling provides enough backstory so that first-time Potter readers will understand the story, and the run-on sentences become fewer with each novel.Five stars.- Harry Potter and the Half-Blood PrinceMy optimism about a clue that was revealed in Order of the Phoenix didn‚Äôt prove correct. *sigh*In Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore‚Äôs Pensieve acts as a marvelous link to backstory that doesn‚Äôt seem like backstory. More information about Voldemort appears via Harry‚Äôs regular meetings with Dumbledore. We are kept guessing throughout most of the novel, and perhaps will be wrong, about Snape‚Äôs true intentions.Although Rowling doesn‚Äôt kill people off with the alacrity of George R. R. Martin, she does dispense with another beloved character. The funeral chapter is well-written, evincing tears and a chuckle or two.I wonder whether Harry will carry through with his plans. Is he really who he, and everyone else, thinks he is, or ‚Ä¶?Now I can‚Äôt wait to tackle Deathly Hallows.Five stars.- Harry Potter and the Deathly HallowsI withdraw my comment about Rowling‚Äôs propensity for killing off characters. However, their demises were necessary in Deathly Hallows; otherwise, the story wouldn‚Äôt ring true. Rowling‚Äôs masterful manipulation of emotions had me smiling, nay, laughing, in some areas‚Äîand tearing up in others.Without providing any spoilers, I wondered throughout why the photo of a key headmaster didn‚Äôt give Harry any advice. Plot hole? In previous novels as well as this one, misleading clues were dropped. Some were essential; others frustrated me because they didn‚Äôt amount to anything.Note to first-time readers: Pay careful attention to clues. You might be able to predict a few twists if you do.Five stars.- General CommentsMs. Rowling‚Äôs style did change somewhat as the novels progressed. Annoying run-on sentences appeared less with each novel.Now I‚Äôm suffering Potter withdrawal. Will we ever see stories about the children of key wizards and witches? No, not screenplays written by others, but novels written by the author herself. I would read them!Five stars for this reading experience, Ms. Rowling, and good luck with future writing endeavors.",TRUE,25-11-2017,"Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2017",545162076

Coffee Lovers Will Delight & Dog Lovers Will Drool In This Darling Story. Don‚Äôt Forget To Download The Free Bonus Epilogue Via The Link At The Back Of The Book!ABOUT THE KNOCKEMOUT SERIES:This is book one of the Knockemout series. To date, the series includes:1. Things We Never Got Over (Knox Morgan & Naomi Witt‚Äôs story)2. Things We Hide from the Light (Nash Morgan & Lina Solavita‚Äôs story)3. Things We Left Behind (Lucian Rollins & Sloane Walton‚Äôs story)Named after a fictional small town in Northern Virginia, the series is full of lively characters, outrageous banter, and lots of steamy chemistry. There are adorable pets and kids that steal your heart. There is also a dose of danger brewing in the background. Geographically, it likely matches up with either real-life Western Loudoun or Clarke County, Virginia. Although the town is vibrant and attracts visitors from nearby Washington, D.C., Knockemout retains its sense of history and a strong feeling of community. It is rumored that the town was named to reflect the way its citizens have long worked out their problems ‚Äì the good old-fashioned way. They fight it out and move on. The town is like a big extended family, with troublemakers, problem-solvers, and a charitable spirit.IN THIS BOOK:The story opens in August.Naomi Witt, thirty-six, is the quintessential good girl. A natural caretaker, she never wants to be a burden to others and always puts herself last. She hadn‚Äôt anticipated the last-minute road trip to Virginia that brought her to Knockemout. She was supposed to be on her honeymoon with Warner. She is a planner, so the change in plans put her way out of her comfort zone. She has a five-year plan and relies upon a plethora of lists to keep her life on track. She bought a home on Long Island worthy of raising a family and had worked in HR for Warner‚Äôs family‚Äôs investment firm for five years. Their four years together as a couple and two years planning the perfect wedding had all been for nothing, though. She tried to be everything to Warner, but she lost herself in the process. She realized her mistake at the last minute, and an unexpected phone call gave her the motivation she needed.Faced with a crisis of her own, Naomi nevertheless dropped everything when she received her estranged twin sister‚Äôs call for help. The timing gave her a place to secretly run away to as well as a distraction. Always the people pleaser, Naomi likes to fix problems. Her sister Tina has always been trouble, but Naomi never anticipated what was waiting for her in Virginia. In the year Tina had lived in Knockemout, she had managed to build herself quite a reputation, and as an identical twin, Naomi soon finds herself reaping the results. She doesn‚Äôt find many friendly faces.Naomi doesn‚Äôt find her sister, but she does end up as Tina‚Äôs latest victim. After having lived through the worst day of her life, the next day isn‚Äôt looking much better. Stuck without a phone, car, or credit card, she is dependent upon the kindness of others. Yet nothing could have prepared her for the discovery that Tina had left behind an eleven-year-old daughter ‚Äì a niece Naomi never knew existed. Doing right by her is never a question. Waylay is tough like her mother, but behind the hard exterior might just be a pre-teen desperate for some normalcy. She is whip-smart but guarded, and Naomi knows that earning Waylay‚Äôs trust will be a huge challenge.Naomi is stuck in Knockemout for at least six months while the custodial arrangement works its way through the legal system. Her entire world pivots as her sense of control is challenged. All of her plans for the future are in upheaval, leaving her adrift with uncertainty. As the locals begin to know Naomi as Not Tina, she begins to settle in. However, there is one particular grumpy Viking of a man that drives her crazy and sets her body on fire at the same time. He is rude and infuriating, and his bad-boy vibe is completely the opposite of Warner's. Almost from the time she rode into town, this man has put himself in the middle of her business, but the last thing she needs with Waylay's custody in limbo is trouble.Knox Morgan, forty-three, is his own man. His good looks, beard, and tattoos give him the quintessential bad-boy vibe, so women love him in spite of his prickly personality. He does what he wants, when he wants, and he wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. Rules are for people like his brother Nash, Knockemout‚Äôs Chief of Police. They have a long history of fighting, but they always made up, too. That changed about three years ago, and things haven‚Äôt been the same between them since. It breaks their grandmother‚Äôs heart. She raised the boys after their mother died, and now what's left of their family is in shambles.Knox knows good things never last, so anything more than a casual relationship has never been on the table for him. He doesn‚Äôt like strings, and he moves on at the first sign of an attachment. He hasn‚Äôt been with a local girl since high school, to the disappointment of many. When he is in the mood for a good chase, he heads out of town for a night or two of fun and pleasure. The routine has grown tiresome, though, which might explain his irresistible attraction to a certain newcomer. Little Miss Daisies in Her Hair is not his type at all. She is uppity and needy, and her vocabulary is too big. He hates that he wants her so badly, but if he cannot have her, nobody can ‚Äì his brother Nash in particular.Knox came into money a few years back, but he didn‚Äôt take it for granted. He has carefully managed his growing portfolio of local businesses, increasing his net worth. He co-owns Whiskey Clipper with his long-time good friend Jeremiah, whose vision has paid off big time. The old barber shop was transformed into a salon that now draws clientele from D.C. A proud barber, people go out of their way to sit in Knox‚Äôs chair. He spends most of his time doing managerial work for his various businesses, though. When his business manager, Sherry Fiasco, hires Naomi behind his back, he realizes that he is in deep trouble. The last thing he needs every day is to see Naomi waitressing at Honky Tonk, his bar.Knox and Naomi have instant chemistry, but things get off to bad start when he confuses her with her delinquent sister. Naomi doesn‚Äôt appreciate being yelled at, and she is tired of always playing nice. Despite his intimidating presence, she pushes back, catching Knox and everyone around him off guard. Their crazy banter soon becomes entertainment for the locals. Denying their attraction to one another eventually proves to be harder than giving in to temptation. Knox is stubbornly stuck in his ways, and Naomi is just trying to get by. They agree that whatever they have is a temporary tryst, but then things get complicated. Neither is ready for a relationship. Things move quickly in their rocky ride, but they eventually earn their happy ending.Don‚Äôt forget to download the free bonus epilogue via the link at the back of the book!Book two, Things We Hide from the Light, follows, in which Knox‚Äôs brother Nash gets his happy ending with Lina. They meet here, in book one.Book three, Things We Left Behind, also gets a brief preview here as Lucian and Sloane‚Äôs backstory is hinted at.Wow! Knox and Naomi‚Äôs story is a fabulous read. The characters and their trendy Northern Virginia town come to life in vivid detail and spectacular dialogue. Their story really sticks with you, and you‚Äôll quickly be reaching for book two so that you can continue to immerse yourself in the Knockemout world. There were eleven laugh-out-loud moments by my count as well as countless witty excerpts scattered throughout. I also came across eight teary scenes. The couple‚Äôs chemistry drips off the page, too.Knox and Naomi are opposites in so many ways. Knox is gruff and intimidating, while Naomi is kind and well-mannered. Knox wears tattoos and doesn‚Äôt always stay within the law, while Naomi wears sundresses and always follows the rules. Knox pushes people away, whereas people are naturally drawn to Naomi. Despite first appearances, however, they actually do have a lot in common. Knox may keep people at a distance, but he is all about giving back. He loves his town, his employees, his friends, and his family, even if he doesn‚Äôt know how to express it. His intentions are easily misconstrued since he is generally so unpleasant. Naomi‚Äôs selfless personality is more obvious, which makes her a prime target for manipulation. Their shared concern for Waylay‚Äôs welfare gives them a distraction from their incessant arguing. It gives them an opening that might not have occurred otherwise because Knox‚Äôs general grouchiness sets the otherwise pleasant Daisy off. He triggers something wild and untamed in her ‚Äì an attribute she abhors.There are a few issues that merit mention. First, there are some timeline issues. There is some inconsistency and vagueness that occasionally causes confusion. I looked back several times to verify but had to make assumptions of my own. My takeaway is that the story opened about 2.5 weeks prior to the first day of school, which would be early August, and the story runs its course by October. The bonus epilogue gives a quick peek at the couple with their family and friends five years down the road. Second, Knox‚Äôs relationships are supposedly short-lived and casual, but later there are a few statements that make it sound as if he has had a history of actual relationships ‚Äì implying something more than casual hookups when in fact he always walks away before it gets that far. Third, there is a point at which I couldn‚Äôt understand why Naomi hadn‚Äôt moved. She had the funds and it would have been appropriate given developments. Fourth, Lina‚Äôs nearly two-decade friendship with Knox post-breakup didn‚Äôt feel credible to me. I would have expected her to lose interest at some point and stop making the effort. Further, the fact that she never met Nash in almost twenty years of friendship is not at all credible. Nash and Knox have a history of fighting, but it is only the last three years that they‚Äôve not been able to make up. That Lina walks into Knox‚Äôs establishment like it is nothing shows Knox has actually brought his out-of-town girlfriends home, or at the very least, he has hung out with Lina in his hometown. In a town that thrives on gossip, that friendship would have been rumored to be more and it would have gotten back to Nash, without a doubt. He would have made it his business to meet her. Finally, I was surprised at Naomi‚Äôs outreach to Tina after so much concern about safety had been voiced. It was used to further the plot, but it made Naomi look thoughtless.Knox and Naomi‚Äôs riotous romance will have you in stitches, but don‚Äôt forget the tissues. Fans of Nicole Snow will love the witty humor and writing style here. Coffee lovers will delight and dog lovers will drool in this darling story. Naomi is a runaway bride who finds herself heated once tattooed Viking Knox starts yelling and telling her what to do. Their enemies-to-lovers one-night-stand transforms into a fake relationship once things get complicated. The story is smartly written. It is a page-turner from the start, although it does slow down a bit in the second half. The plot is fairly simple. Knockemout comes to life in this story. The characters are wonderfully defined, and the couple‚Äôs romantic tension is palpable. There is a large cast of colorful and unique characters. The story is told in first person. The POV alternates between Knox and Naomi. I rate this book 4.5 stars.",TRUE,23-02-2023,"Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2023",194563183X
751,Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout),"Grumpy ML, Strong female lead, romance, heartfelt & more!",Briana Bailon,5,"Grumpy man who is unable to stop thinking about woman, said woman‚Äôs life turning upside down after her twin sister stole her money, car, and then found out she had an eleven year old niece! Talk about a lot going on for Naomi Witt. This story had everything I could possibly want and more from the grumpiness of Knox, Naomi trying to figure out the whirlwind mess that became her life, and somehow in the mist of all the drama, love found a way, and there were some added heartfelt moments as well as funny moments too!Right from the start, Naomi had just come out of a big mess, but just when she thought things couldn‚Äôt get any worse, her twin sister Tina, stole all of Naomi‚Äôs things, and left her to care for her niece, Waylay, who she didn‚Äôt even know existed. Add into the mix the ever so grumpy and tough Knox, who seemed to not only make Naomi angry, but frustrated both mentally and physically *wink, wink. Knox seemed annoyed yet somehow fascinated by Naomi from the way she carried herself to low key checking out her Facebook to see everything about her, to having some spicy dreams about Naomi that left him wanting her in ways he had never felt before. Not to mention, Knox downright telling Naomi to her face that she wasn‚Äôt his ‚Äútype‚Äù haha very funny Knox because based off the way he acted towards her throughout the story would seem otherwise. So you could only imagine the tension that occurred between Naomi and Knox was both a pleasure and entertaining to watch unfold.I loved seeing Naomi adapt to the new changes in her life a.k.a. trying to care of Waylay and trying to be the best guardian she could be for her, especially since Tina (Waylay‚Äôs mom) never cared for her, and treated her badly. Naomi wasn‚Äôt the only one who cared for Waylay, but also Knox, Nash, Liza J, and Naomi‚Äôs parents, and the whole town of Knockemout. Having those people rally around Waylay and provide her with both love and support was so heartwarming to see. Plus you could tell that Waylay appreciated having that sense of true family around her since she never really had that to begin with. Naomi struggled in the beginning trying to grapple with ways to connect with Waylay, and provide her with all the necessities she could possibly need and want. Thankfully with the residential grumpy man that was Knox, he definitely went above and beyond to help Naomi with Waylay.Through the drama that came with Tina and trying to make sure Waylay was taken care of, Naomi had a lot on her plate, but somehow during all of it, she caught the eye of Knox. What I found so amusing with Knox was that he was aware that he was grumpy and *cough a bit rude to Naomi, but what also made me laugh was that he would sometimes complain about constantly thinking about Naomi or felt kind of annoyed having to pull her out of trouble. In all honesty though, Knox wanted to help out Naomi because he genuinely wanted to be there for her. If anything, Knox wasn‚Äôt use to the feelings that Naomi brought out in him, and therefore resorted to being his grumpy self and blamed his body‚Äôs reaction to only wanting Naomi in a purely physical way. Haha joke was on Knox because based off the chemistry he and Naomi had, their connection went beyond just physical. While I will say, the passion between those two was AMAZING (especially reading it!) the spice, the dirty talk, and pure wanting lust between was‚Ä¶ WHOA! And of course we can‚Äôt forget how demanding and possessive Knox was over Naomi.In addition, I loved how Knox became sort of Naomi‚Äôs unofficial yet official caretaker, provider in a way. Naomi was so use to taking care of everyone from always cleaning up Tina‚Äôs messes to literally doing everything for Ex in her previous relationship, Naomi did it all! Knox saw that Naomi always put others needs before her own, and he wanted to be the one to take care of Naomi. Something in the pit of Knox‚Äôs gut just had this natural instinct of protection over Naomi, wanted to be her ‚Äúhero‚Äù.This story was absolutely amazing! I loved that with each chapter, I was drawn in more by the characters, the plot, and the overall feeling I got while reading. I couldn‚Äôt put this book down, and if I wasn‚Äôt reading it, I was thinking about it constantly! I especially loved the tight knit community that was in Knockemout. How everyone helped one another, came together as a community, and the overall support everyone provided for Naomi and Waylay. This story captured my heart, Naomi and Knox definitely had some bumps in the road, but they ultimately had their ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù. Just when I thought the story ended on a beautiful note, the epilogue& bonus epilogue had me weeping tears of joy.

753,Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout),I didn‚Äôt like Knox,Ash,4,"3.5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è Slight Spoilers if you haven‚Äôt read this‚Ä¶This was my second time reading TWNGO. The first time I probably would have given 5 stars. The me that read it a second time didn‚Äôt love it as much. I still loved it but my least fav part of the book was Knox, the MMC. He‚Äôs a toxic jerk. I‚Äôm all for a broody, grumpy lead guy but he was beyond that for me. The third act breakup was fine for me except that he was getting her naked while formulating a plot to break her heart. Cringe. I don‚Äôt mind third act breakups but him going from one extreme (breaking up with her) to telling her(not asking her)they were getting married was‚Ä¶ idk I just didn‚Äôt love it. I‚Äôm not a Knox fan this time around. Sorry.I do like Naomi though. I feel like the coffee part of her personality went a little too far when that was her first word after she almost died buuuut I still mostly liked her. Her storyline with her niece, Waylay, was the best parts of this book, in my opinion. I love Waylay. (Side note: that teacher who messed with Way deserved to be fired, among other things, not retired.)The secondary characters were also great. I love Stef, Lucian, and Sloane. I liked Lina enough that I‚Äôm hoping the second book will win me over! I do still like this book overall. I love Lucy Score. It just hit me a little different than the first time I read it.",TRUE,07-09-2023,"Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2023",194563183X
754,Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout),Really great book about trauma and choosing love over fear! Book is too long though,NCR,4,"The book gave me that sad, nostalgic feeling of ""wow that was a really beautiful book.""1) The book is a beautiful story about overcoming trauma - specifically fears about falling in love. This happens for a lot of books (I'm thinking Ugly Love as another popular romance book). But really this book has realistic trauma situations and there are so many pages that you really see the characters change and unravel from their pain points. So by the end, I really understood the two main characters (there are alternating chapter POVs!). The author explained in the note at the end that some of her friends had some tragedies happen to them while she was writing this book, and that helped her realize this book would be about choosing to love even when you know it could hurt. It's definitely the message and theme of this book so it's super good in that way. This book doubles as a therapy session tbh. In the world of mental health/relationship psychology, I would highly recommend this book. You're basically watching an anxious-avoidant relationship both become more secure (hence the title of the book: Things We Never Got Over)2) This book is too long. I'm really not kidding. The first 20 chapters should have been cut in half like at best. The author said in the author's note she did not know what the book would be about when she wrote it, I kinda see that still. It's just a lot of romance building and when I tell you the second half of the book is SOOO strong with all the conflict and juicy drama, the length of first half was not needed. Like not needed. As someone who reads a lot of scripts for shows/movies, I am a big fan that every word on a page as a writer should be earned, and so much of the beginning was truly boring to the plot. I am impressed by the original readers who kept on going and then gave the book high reviews. I truly just kept on reading because this book was talked about so much that I had to see the hype. In Hindsight, I would have read a summary online for the first half of the book and then skipped to chapter 21 and started reading the book from then on. Still would have been an over 300-page book to read.3) This should be an exciting series! The author interweaves other characters' love lives so there will be more books in the future that let us see these other characters fall in love. I am so excited cause Lucy and Sloane brought the heat that sometimes I was more engaged in their bickering than in Noami and Knox's.4) There's sunshine / grumpy love and then there's like good girl submissive energy / bad boy dominant energy love and this relationship is more the latter. Grumpy guy's usually aren't rude to the actual girl (they are more like thoughtful grumpies...like Adam Carlsen or Luke Danes). This guy at the beginning was just straight rude to the female lead. I was like now what the heck. And home girl had like no backbone to him, for 90% of this book. Like he straight disrespected her many times so I wasn't really into him as a character. I just have a distate for men treating women like garbage but then buying them gifts and so its supposed to be okay? (um no.) until of course then in the end I got more proud of him over time, but to me he's definitely a guy where he's not really my type. (But for those who read the book, I'm probably more of a girl like Sloane.) So yes just a heads up for readers, it's more of the good girl / bad boy chemistry.5) LOTS of relationship psychology and psycho-analyzing. Sometimes I liked it, other times I felt that the author copied and pasted therapy quotes online and put them into the book. As in it was very generic quotes about choosing love over fear. This book is full of a lot of emotionally unintelligent grown adults being told things they should have learned in their 20s. How have both of the leads not worked through their relationship patterns by now or been told them before? These are conversations people usually have in their 20s, but it might just be a generational thing that people are learning how to heal later. But just a heads up that characters are being told advice that seemed very young to hear for their age. They easily could have been in their 20s in terms of their behavior.Overall:Really great book about trauma and choosing love over fear! Way too long of a book, really strong second half, and would highly recommend it if you like good girl/bad boy love tropes or like relationship psychology since there is a lot of relationship psycho-analyzing that the characters do with each other.",TRUE,06-07-2022,"Reviewed in the United States July 6, 2022",194563183X

780,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) (The Hunger Games),This is not a hero story,Anne Pruitt,5,"4.5 starsAmazon delivered my copy early, so I'm going to do a spoiler free review and then a spoilery one. Pardon if this winds up sounding like an English paper. I have thought so much on the morals and questions in this book that I feel like I should have read this in school.Note: I'm writing this review with the express belief that you, reader, have at least read the book description. Otherwise why are you reading this review?I want to start this off by saying two things. One, this is not a hero story. Snow is never once, in my opinion, shown to be a hero in this in what we modern folks would call a hero. He's no Luke Skywalker or redeemed villain. This isn't some sob backstory to explain ""why the bad guy is bad."" This is yet another set of layers to the onion that is Snow.Second, this book is dark. It's been a minute since I read the original trilogy, but I swear it wasn't quite as graphic as this book was. Cannibalism is mentioned, and it's shown/talked about that someone sawed the leg off a dead woman and ran off with it. One character is killed then hung on a hook and paraded. Another is also gruesomely displayed after their death. Several characters are dragged through processions to ""prove a point,"" another character is hung from two large poles and left to basically die in the sun. Multiple accounts of vomiting/poison throughout, and a general unpleasantness at the lack of regard for human life.Non-spoilery review:This book makes you think. A lot. It makes you question things, and wonder if maybe Snow is right (he's not), but it's written in such a way that he's not a villain. Donald Sutherland in an interview made a great point in saying that Snow isn't a villain, he's just a ruthless man doing what he thinks is right to keep his home and country in one piece.""He does it so well. And he doesn't think he's a bad person. He thinks it's the only way society can survive. And whether you think he's right or wrong, he doesn't think he's bad. He likes himself.""This should be the mantra for this book. Snow is a conflicting, flawed human. In our society, he's evil, a sociopath or a psychopath. He's a murderer and a killer. He's a bad guy. In his world, he's one of the masses. He simply lives as he's been raised to, with a mentality that has been ingrained in him since the war between the Districts and the Capitol. He's simply more ruthless then most and has the guts to make what he considers the ""hard decisions.""Regardless of the other characters in this, they're all props to his story--which fits well with the Snow we know from The Hunger Games. Everyone is second stage to Snow and his life. This is his evolution from being a child to a man, to becoming the Snow we know and love/hate.I definitely don't think this book is for everyone. I'm sitting here with my mom breathing down my neck because she can't wait to read it, and I don't think she'll like it at all, and she's a diehard THG trilogy fan. Why? Because not everyone likes to read depressing books. There's no redemption in this. There's no saving someone from themselves. This is the fall, stumble, plummet into being a not great person and embracing it fully.So take that as you will. Full spoilers below about everything.P.s. This is a standalone.SPOILERS BELOWOkay, so, I was worried about this book when I read the first chapter sample and it got announced that Snow would be training the District 12 girl. I thought, oh crap, it's gonna be a cliche YA. It's gonna have a stupid romance that undercuts the whole plot and makes him a sap. And yeah, it did that, and up until the last 50 pages I was teetering on a 3-3.5 stars. And then oh boy, the end.Lucy Grey was a sweet girl, but she felt off since the beginning. I still can't fully put my finger on it, but her and Snow's relationship felt so <i>wrong</i> the entirety of the book. The red flags went up repeatedly every time he made comments about how she was his, and even so far as to say she was his property, and that's all kinds of wrong. And even though their romance was cute and fluffy, it felt bad, tainted. You knew something was going to happen. It always does in these villain backstories. Usually the whole reason the villain is bad is because the love interest gets brutally killed and then they're like whelp, guess I'll just be evil.Not in this book.Snow constantly struggles with morality and right and wrong throughout this. Should he turn in his friend to the Capitol because they're colluding with rebels and could tear down the (flawed) infrastructure? Or should he turn a blind eye and let his friend do his own thing? Is the Hunger Games wrong or good? Is it wrong to view the District people as second class humans? And so on. This book broaches the topic of racism in very broad terms with the whole District/Capitol thing. You've always known there was a divide between them, but in this, you really see how much the Capitol looks down on the Districts, and you can easily see how that morphs into such a hatred and distaste by the time Katniss first enters the Hunger Games.But I digress. Snow struggles with morality, but he's flawed and very, very imperfect. He rationalizes every death he takes as self-defense or some other reason when really he's just murdered someone because it's inconvenient for him. He kills (or at least removes her from the picture; it's ambiguous) Lucy Grey in the end because she's a loose end and too free. He does it. Not someone else, not some freak accident. He chooses to do it and, by the time it happens, you already know what direction he's headed in so it's not quite another nail in the coffin. It fully feels like him tying up loose ends so he can go do whatever he wants.All the nods to THG characters and names was cool. You also had a lot of The Great Gatsby vibes in the Old Money versus New Money mentality that a lot of the Capitol had with District people who gained a fortune and bought their way into the Capitol life. They're looked down upon by the old families and viewed as trash.You saw a lot of the evolution in the Hunger Games, and you can see how it begins to change and grow into what Katniss and Peeta suffered through. You see how it begins to change from a simple punishment to a sport and a holiday, with the growing encouragement that it should be a normal and good thing.You also see a side of the Capitol you most definitely did not see in the trilogy--suffering. A lot of the book shows Snow struggling with having been a small child living through the Dark Days and the war. He was 8 when the Capitol won, and even then it was hard. You learn about the hell the Capitol lived through as they were besieged by the Districts' army and forced to ration, starvation, and cannibalism. It's a hard picture, and it's so blatantly told. Collins didn't hold back any punches in this. I never felt like what was done was for shock and awe for the reader, but it was definitely that for the story, and it made sense. Regardless of the Capitol not being at war with the Districts anymore, the tensions were still so high that it makes sense for the Capitol to overreact in their retaliation of events. So when one mentor gets killed by her tribute, they shoot the tribute and parade her body around on a hook at the mentor's funeral. It's disgusting, debasing, and shows how much the Capitol views the Districts as nothing more than rodents or livestock.Anyway, I'll stop talking. Go read it yourself. It's a hard read, a heavy read, but it was very, very enjoyable.",TRUE,24-05-2020,"Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2020",1338635174
781,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) (The Hunger Games),"Ted Bundy, Coriolanus and The Joker",MJ,5,"The Ballad of Songbirds and SnakesAs most readers already know, this prequel explores Coriolanus's life when he was a teenager. The opening chapters reveal that he was also chosen to be a mentor for Lucy Gray who was from the despised district 12.But what she lacks in fighting skills she makes up for being a charismatic performer. Lucy Gray learned how to work a situation to her advantage.In the beginning the tributes did not enjoy Capitol luxuries but were kept in cages and barely fed. It‚Äôs a stark contrast to the future hunger games when tributes were met with an extravagant welcome and dined on rich foods.The problem was that watching too much brutality turned the Capitol away from the Games. Snow's addition to the Hunger Games of costumes, interviews, and the underdog tributes made the propaganda go down easy. This should be a cautionary tale.A lot of readers are not getting the point the author is trying to make. In the opening of this book there's a quote by Hobbes:‚ÄúHereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man.‚Äù ‚Äî Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, 1651Coriolanus's first ""lesson"" to be molded into the future oppressor was during the Hunger Games; when he was forced to go in the arena to get out Sejanus, one of the mentors, who was not supposed to be in there. While at the hospital getting stitches, the head gamekeeper, Dr. Gaul, asked if Coriolanus understood what he was supposed to learn.‚ÄúWithout the threat of death, it wouldn‚Äôt have been much of a lesson,‚Äù said Dr. Gaul. ‚ÄúWhat happened in the arena? That‚Äôs humanity undressed. The tributes. And you, too. How quickly civilization disappears. All your fine manners, education, family background, everything you pride yourself on, stripped away in the blink of an eye, revealing everything you actually are. A boy with a club who beats another boy to death. That‚Äôs mankind in its natural state.‚Äù‚ÄúI think I wouldn‚Äôt have beaten anyone to death if you hadn‚Äôt stuck me in that arena!‚Äù he retorted.‚ÄúYou can blame it on the circumstances, the environment, but you made the choices you made, no one else. It‚Äôs a lot to take in all at once, but it‚Äôs essential that you make an effort to answer that question. Who are human beings? Because who we are determines the type of governing we need. Later on, I hope you can reflect and be honest with yourself about what you learned tonight.‚ÄùA very similar thought process was also stated by the Joker in The Dark Night:‚ÄúTo them, you‚Äôre just a freak, like me! They need you right now, but when they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll cast you out, like a leper! You see, their morals, their code, it‚Äôs a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They‚Äôre only as good as the world allows them to be. I‚Äôll show you. When the chips are down, these‚Ä¶ these civilized people, they‚Äôll eat each other. See, I‚Äôm not a monster. I‚Äôm just ahead of the curve.‚ÄùBoth the Joker and Dr. Gaul has distorted thinking. It's one thing to make a choice freely and it's quite another thing to be forced into one.Human nature is such that coercive enforcement of rules is indispensable to protect the rights of all but there is a fine line between government rule and government oppression.Later, as Coriolanus's feelings toward Lucy Gray grew, he helped her to survive the games only to get caught and was sent to train with the peacekeepers in her district. Sejanus joined him there soon after.Sejanus was never one who was comfortable with the Capital and its way of life. He got a plan to help the districts by providing the rebels with guns for their flight up north, out of Panem.Coriolanus found out about Sejanus‚Äô plot. Mayfair threatens to tell her father [the Mayor] everything, which would implicate Coriolanus and Lucy Gray despite them being only bystanders; he shot her.Sejanus is charged with treason and hanged. And Lucy Gray Baird is the main suspect in Billy Taupe [her ex rebel boyfriend] and Mayfair‚Äôs deaths, as he left her for the mayor‚Äôs daughter.In desperation, Lucy Gray decides to join the rebels up north and Coriolanus decides to go with her, thinking there's nothing left of his life once the murder weapons were found.But as they prepare to flee district 12, Snow gets paranoid that Lucy Gray is betraying him. When they stop at a house near district 12‚Äôs lake, he discovers the rebels‚Äô store of the weapons. When Lucy Gray takes a long time to cut up some katniss plants, he convinces himself that she has abandoned him and went to turn him in.""What if they interrogated or even tortured her? The story would come out. She hadn't killed anyone. He had. His word against hers"".But even though Snow searches for her, Lucy Gray was nowhere to be found.The three killings that Snow did throughout the book contributed to his downward spiral and PTSD. Coriolanus clubbed to death a tribute, Bobbin, in the Hunger Games arena. He also shoots the mayor's daughter and also turns in his best friend, Sejanus, for treason, resulting in his execution.Lucy Gray was the last straw for his sanity. Back at the Capital the reader sees Snow's change to ""the dark side"".""Sometimes he would remember a moment of sweetness and almost wish things had ended differently. But it would never have worked out between them, even if he‚Äôd stayed. They were simply too different. And he didn‚Äôt like love, the way it had made him feel stupid and vulnerable. If he ever married, he‚Äôd choose someone incapable of swaying his heart. Someone he hated, even, so they could never manipulate him the way Lucy Gray had. Never make him feel jealous. Or weak. Livia Cardew would be perfect. He imagined the two of them, the president and his first lady, presiding over the Hunger Games a few years from now. He‚Äôd continue the Games, of course, when he ruled Panem. People would call him a tyrant, ironfisted and cruel. But at least he would ensure survival for survival‚Äôs sake, giving them a chance to evolve. What else could humanity hope for? Really, it should thank him.""This happened to Ted Bundy as I believe one of the main reasons he became a serial killer was because his first love dumped him. If you were to get all his victims lined up together you would think they were all sisters and you will notice that they all look like his first girlfriend.Rejection is a powerful force in a person's life if they are not stable. Dr. Gaul planted the seeds for that rejection to take root and grow.",TRUE,25-07-2020,"Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2020",1338635174
782,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) (The Hunger Games),A fantastic villain origin story,Holly,5,"I adored the Hunger Games series. Dystopian YA is not a normal genre for me, but this series is awesome and this prequel? A fantastic villain origin story.Coriolanus Snow is an ambitious 18-year-old student whose wealthy family barely survived the war. He is all about image and pretense, which often vie against his normal, human feelings. His parents are dead and he lives in a rundown apartment with his grandmother and cousin Tigris.But, the 10th Hunger Games is to be the first one with mentors and Coriolanus has been chosen to mentor the female tribute from District 12. While at first humiliated at not being given a more highly rated district, he quickly realizes that Lucy Gray is someone who could win and it's up to him to figure out how to help her do that. Along the way, Coriolanus learns about love and the dangers it can bring.As he works his way through the Games, he also discovers who wields the power in the Capitol, who controls the games and what he needs to do to rise up above the masses.The student mentors also have a say in how the games are run, and in a somewhat twisted sort of way, their professor gives assignments and in Coriolanus' essays, we see how future Games come about and evolve. As the mentors talk about the games and what is happening, we also see how they are not all unfeeling or unkind. They view their tributes as people and they can see how unfair the Games really are. At the same time we see that those in the Capitol are only concerned about their well being and that their losses are because of the rebels.The Hunger Games series is vibrant and colorful in its imagery. This book, however, was almost more black and gray in its imagery, what with the rubble of the arena and the Capitol still trying to rebuild from the war. That made the contrast of Lucy Gray's colorful skirt and the snakes all the more striking.As with the rest of the series, we see the government oppression, we see the results of war and rebellion. We see society broken, but fighting and we see that even with survival, life isn't grand and colorful. But we also see that the human spirit is strong.No one likes who President Snow becomes and I think writing about his story so that he gains the reader's sympathy is brilliant. The story isn't fast-paced, but it drew me in and kept me enthralled.",TRUE,09-09-2023,"Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2023",1338635174
783,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) (The Hunger Games),An author's initial perspective on The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,L.V. Fucanan,5,"As a YA Dystopian author, I wanted to learn from the best so I purchased this book on my birthday, just a day after I published my own dystopian book.The Hunger Games series sparked my passion for writing, so this book holds a special place in my heart. But I knew I had to let go of that bias because this is an entirely new thing. I need to read this not as a reader, but as an author. So I approached this book with a careful eye, just like any other character who approaches a jabberjay in the series.The perspective of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes isn't new to me simply because it's from the villain's voice. It's ""new"" in a way as it explores the coming of age tale of Coriolanus Snow's cleverly paranoid overthinking mind.I knew what will happen to Coriolanus Snow, so I gripped my seat as I approved 80% in my Kindle Oasis. It was simply impossible. I don't see anything bad from happening. I asked myself, ""How will Suzanne Collins end this?""And she did.And I couldn't believe it.It was so captivating that I couldn't put it down. I will not put any spoilers here, but I just want to say... Inevitable as the sunrise, betrayals leave behind a trail of destruction for the snake.

784,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) (The Hunger Games),Quite the read...,Mama2one,5,"I have such mixed emotions after finishing this book, but first of all - this book is absolutely incredible. I honestly think it might be my favorite book of the HG series (!) and Ms. Collins absolutely does not disappoint with her writing and content. Getting to read about Panem, and thus the beginning of the HG was so gratifying and the way this story flowed into, and matched up with, the trilogy was absolutely flawless. Truly, it is excellent!Now - it's kind of rare to read a book when the protagonist is the villain. We all clearly know from the HG trilogy that President Snow is a pretty terrible person, yet reading this book, from his point of view, it's easy to forget that; but it's also fascinating to see how he thinks of himself and sees his own actions. Along that same thought - Snow is very charismatic and definitely knows how to work the people around him to get what he wants or to present himself in a way that will clearly benefit himself, often at the cost of someone else.~~Minor spoiler ~~The other part of Snow's life that I do find incredibly sad - while he definitely has poor character traits to begin with, he was also very manipulated by several people around him, which I think added *considerably* to how he turned out as an adult and VERY much shaped his viewpoint, and his creation of the games.So definitely worth the read (and re-read). This book is very thought-provoking, even from outside the dystopian viewpoint. There are a lot of reflections on who WE are - as humans; as groups & societies; on the roles of government and the rights of its citizens.For the many pages, it reads quickly!

787,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) (The Hunger Games),Great Addition to the Series,Dalton O,4,"""The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" by Suzanne Collins is a captivating and original addition to the Hunger Games series. This prequel takes readers on a journey to understand the origins of the Hunger Games and explores the complex character of Coriolanus Snow, who later becomes President Snow, giving him a lot more nuance than previously afforded. The story delves into the darker and more morally complex aspects of the Hunger Games world, offering a fresh perspective on the events that led to the dystopian society depicted in the original trilogy. While it may not have the same level of action and intensity as the earlier books, it compensates with its rich character development and thought-provoking themes and the lack of 'action' makes sense given the setting and novelty of the Hunger Games at that point. This novel is a must-read for fans of the Hunger Games series, as it adds depth and complexity to a world we thought we knew so well, making it an enthralling and thought-provoking experience from start to finish.

790,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 3)",Three books review and a little spoilers,jhfreeborn,5,"These were some of the best books I‚Äôve read in a long time. Sarah left nothing undone when it came to describing a world that doesn‚Äôt exist. Her story was original in many ways and in others you could see how it was similar to many others of its genre. Her characters were so engaging. You could feel there happiness, their pain, their conflict. I would recommend these books to everyone who loves fantasy. Oh and the fight scenes although not throughly detailed was enough to draw you in and make you feel as though you were in the battle with them.I know there are two other books. Number 4 is a very long epilogue so if you want to check up on Feyre and Rhys family, that‚Äôd be the book. Book 5 is Nesta‚Äôs book. I have not read that book and will be putting it off for awhile because in all honesty she was one of the only characters in the book I really did not like. Having said that I‚Äôm sure book 5 is supposed to be somewhat of a book redeeming her but I‚Äôm a little upset that she gets a book and Lucien doesn‚Äôt or Azriel for that matter.They were the only two characters that had the saddest back ground and deserved a HEA, not Nesta she was a grade a b****. Mor could be seen as another character that had a tragic back story and in need of an HEA, but I don‚Äôt agree. I hate how she strings Azriel along because she is a selfish coward, just like Nesta, but not so much of a heartless B.If Sarah does come out with books for these worthy males I hope she chooses a different female for them than Elaine. Lucien deserves someone who will love him the way Feyre loves Rhys. And Elaine needs a male who‚Äôll love her the way Rhys loves Feyre. I cannot see Elaine and Lucien having that same connection as the two I mentioned. and Azriel cannot love sweet Elaine that way either cause he will always be tied in someway to Mor. You can‚Äôt drop 400+ years of longing and insta fall for someone else, especially if she‚Äôs not his mate, which Mor is. Azriel will always put Mor before Elaine. When Mor comes clean and finally lets Azriel go he‚Äôll need time to heal and that would be a good time for someone, not in their circle, to help him through that. One could argue with time and the right setup Elaine and Lucien could make it work and be just as enthralled with each other as our power couple, but Lucien has some soul searching to do. Something Rhys didn‚Äôt have to do. He was everything Feyre needed.Finally Tamlin. Some would put him in the same category as Nesta and Mor but I don‚Äôt. Tamlin has a good heart. Feyre broke that heart. Did Tamlin handle things wrong? Yes but he could have been so much more hateful, and wasn‚Äôt. Instead he came to there aid, saved Feyre, spied for the alliance and even helped bring Rhys back to life, because he absolutely loved Feyre. His book would be an adventure for sure. The female would have to be fierce as well as soft and definitely more mature than Feyre. She matured quite a bit after everything that happened under the mountain but Tamlins and Feyres love was built before that and had she been more mature she wouldn‚Äôt have fallen for him so easily she would have been more cautious and discerning. My heart broke a little for him. Even if I am team Rhys and Feyre.Just my two cents. Enjoy reading these books!!",TRUE,30-08-2023,"Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2023",1635575605

I was worried that after A Court of Mist and Fury that the rest of the series would not hold up. While ACOMAF is my favorite so far AOWAR definitely held it own.I love all the new characters that we got to meet in this book along with all the new relationships.I love the connection between all the high lords. We get to see a lot more of their history and the relationships that they all had prior to the current timeline.Many secrets were reveled in this book... or more so truths that have not yet been told.Mor and her secret that now only Feyre knows. I love this direction for her but I also am sadden for the relationship I was hoping for, for her and Azriel. I hope that in the future books we get to see more of their friendship. I hope they will both have new love interest in the future books.Herion and Lucian... Father and son. I Hope this is something that gets brought up again in the net book.The relationships that still have so much questioning and I cannot wait to see what happens.Obviously my favorite is Feyre and Rhys. Enough said.Cassian and Nesta. Are they mates? Not mate? WHAT? I need more. I need to know! There is something more there and I cannot wait to read more to find out.Amern and Varian.

""He calls himself the Prince of Merchants"" ‚ÄúHe told me he's got three daughters who live here. And that he failed them for many years. But he would not fail them this time."" The ships at the front of the human armada became clear, along with the gold lettering on their sides. ""He named his three personal ships after them,"" Drakon said with a smile. And there, sailing at the front...I beheld the names of those ships.The Feyre.The ElainAnd leading the charge against Hybern, flying over the waves, unyielding and without an ounce of fear‚Ä¶The NestaWith my father‚Ä¶our father at the helm.I love this for these three so much. I completely forgot about their father and kind of just wrote him off. Then out of nowhere he has been battling and rallying for his girls. He didn‚Äôt know they were fae and was right in the middle of everything happening but he knew they were there and need help. I am sad that the King of Hybern killed their father. I would have really like to see more of his thoughts on becoming them becoming fae and what happened to them in his absence.2. Amren‚Äôs betraying/ not betraying Feyre. Let me tell ya I was so mad for a hot minute. I had to put the book down. I could not believe what was happening. I was thinking no way Amren is on the wrong side of this. She has helped and done so much. Then the twist.The Suriel left the message to Feyre for Amren. For Amren to release her true self so that she alone can defeat Hyberns army. The begging from both Feyre and Varian for Amren not to release her true self because she would not remember them. She would not be able to return. But she is able to come back but she now is different.She looked to Varian, a wry smile on her red mouth. ‚ÄúI watched them most‚Äîthe humans who loved. I never understood it‚Äîhow it happened. Why it happened.‚Äù She paused a step away from the Cauldron. ‚ÄúI think I might have learned with you, though. Perhaps that was a last gift, too.‚Äù Varian‚Äôs face twisted with anguish. But he made no further move to stop her. She turned to me. And spoke the words into my head‚Äîthe spell I must think and feel and do. I nodded. ‚ÄúWhen I am free,‚Äù Amren said to us, ‚Äúdo not run.

And swung herself into the Cauldron3. Rhys dying. I did not see this coming! I have never had a book where one of my favorite characters dies. Or a main character die. I normally love the smaller characters more. Call me cheesy but I love, love. When he died and once Feyre noticed what had happened, my gut wrenched.Rhys was sprawled on the rocky ground, wings draped behind him. He looked like he was sleeping. But as I breathed in‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt there. That thing that rose and fell with each breath. That echoed each heartbeat. The mating bond. It wasn‚Äôt there. It was gone. Because his own chest ‚Ä¶ it was not moving. And Rhys was dead.The after math of this was just a much heart wrenching, maybe even worse. Feyre begging everyone to help Rhys and just when you think no one can help him. Feyre asks the high lords to bring him back like they did her. They need them all to do it, even Tamlin.

792,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 3)","The war has come, who will survive and who will lose everything? (SPOILERS)",Alyshia,5,"o This is the climax of the series as far as I am concerned. This book gets a lot of hate, but it is honestly, my favorite book of the series.o OVERVIEW: SPOILERS: I have NEVER in my life had so many feelings about a man in my real life let alone in a book. I lost count how many times I closed this book and just shook the crap out of it because Tamlin made me so mad. GOOD LORD MAN. This dang book had me so in my feelings about everything every single time I turned the page.o This is the climax of the Night Court story itself, the war with Hybern and trying to save the Fae Lands and the Courts. Hybern makes a deal with Tamlin and they bring the Night Court to his court and drag in Feyre‚Äôs human sisters, forcing them into the Cauldron to become made. But what they don‚Äôt know is that Nesta, ever the fighter, took from the cauldron just as it was taking from her and her sister. Which was when the Human Queens (part of the treaty) see that Hybern promised immortality from the cauldron with the sisters as tests, run but something was taken from Cauldron so it takes from the next one in the Cauldron, therefore making the Queens mad. War comes, Nesta saves Cassian twice, Hybern kills the girls‚Äô father and Elain stabs him but Nesta has the killshot and removes his head, the girls‚Äô father shows up with an armada when Drakon and Myriam show up with boats named after the girls, the cauldron calls Elain and they search for her. Feyre and Amren and Varian find the Cauldron but Amren deceives Feyre and dives into the Cauldron, she becomes her true form and wipes out mostly everything in the war with fire. The Cauldron explodes into three pieces and Rhys and Feyre save it by mending it back together because Feyre remembers that all life comes from the Cauldron, but when she comes back to reality, Rhys is lying on the ground and not breathing. She begs the high lords to fix him like they did her, so they do and he comes back.o Along the way, Feyre faces fears that the Bone Carver told her about to free him to get him to fight with them against Hybern, also faces Bryaxis (the dark thing in the lowest level of the library where the Priestesses work at the House of Wind). Rhys frees the Weaver of the Wood (Bone Carvers sister) to help as well. Hybern kills the Bone Carver and the Weaver of the Wood and Bryaxis is still missing at the end of the book.o There is just so freaking much that happens in this book and that is why it is my favorite. The weaving of stories is immaculate within this book. I know that quite a few people don‚Äôt like Sarah J. Mass‚Äô writing but I did for sure. I‚Äôm also new to the Fae writing, etc. However, I did definitely like this one the best out of all of them and I would re-read it 2942359798 times if I could.

I will try my best to make this spoiler-free because SO MUCH happens!Now, this book came to me on its release day (thank you, Amazon). I started reading it almost immediately and then I had exams. This is why it took me so long to finish it. I would try to read it before work or before class, but I wouldn‚Äôt be fast enough.So, we know what happened in the second book. Feyre went back to Tamlin, but surprise! It‚Äôs just a little trick. She will find her way back to Rhysand.Duh, she does. That‚Äôs not really a spoiler.War is looming and she, as the High Lady, must work with the Night Court and her mate, Rhysand, in order to win this war and bring peace to all. Literally.So, I want to write this review differently. We love these characters so much, so I am going to break it down by character. No spoilers will be revealed for the characters. I will be careful.New characters are introduced in this book, but I will be letting you know about the familiar characters.- Feyre -So, the ending of the second book had us shook. For real. In the third book, Feyre is truly a badass. She is not taking any of Tamlin‚Äôs shit, let me tell you that. She is determined to find her way back to Rhysand and, yes she does, as noted above. When they reunite, of course there is the love-making. They wouldn‚Äôt be mates if they didn‚Äôt get it on, you know? Anyway...it‚Äôs a bit of an emotional reunion for Feyre, seeing her friends and such. Especially her sisters. We get a glimpse of them almost immediately, but I‚Äôll talk about them lately. Throughout the book, Feyre is now a High Lady of the Night Court. She slowly learns how to control a room and she learns more about herself. This book really shows us how strong Feyre really is.- Rhysand -Right now, Rhysand is probably going through hell because he isn‚Äôt with Feyre and he isn‚Äôt sure when she will be back. It gets kind of worse when Feyre tries to get back to him. During that journey, their bond is silent. When they reunite, you get that giddy feeling reading their interactions again and I‚Äôm actually glad their separation doesn‚Äôt really last long. This is only if you ship them, though. In this book, I definitely got a sense of a struggle with Rhysand. It‚Äôs almost as if the ending of the second book and its events really made him vulnerable and he is definitely scared of losing Feyre and we learn more about his time with Amarantha when he was her icky love slave or whatever. We learn more things, too. I like this side of him, this vulnerable side. There are moments during the impending war where he expresses his fear of losing his family. I‚Äôm going to say that there is a moment with Rhysand where you stare at the book and you want to burst into tears. That‚Äôs all. No spoilers.- Lucien -Everybody wants Lucien. They wanted more of Lucien. I‚Äôm going to say, in my own opinion, that I was kind of disappointed in Lucien‚Äôs part of the story. I feel like there was not enough of him. He seemed to be absent, physically, for over half of the book. Before its release, I saw that people were excited to read more of Lucien and his POV. But, I was disappointed that it was lacking. I think his story isn‚Äôt over yet, though. There didn‚Äôt seem to be any closure for him. Hopefully, since this world continues, we will get more.- Nesta -Oh, Nesta. I think she is a love/hate character. We get more of her in this book and she becomes more likable, though still frustrating. Let‚Äôs just say the situation between her and Cassian drags and it just makes you roll your eyes. Not at Sarah, of course. At Nesta. She is so stubborn and it just annoyed me at times. However, with that aside, she definitely learns to become stronger and to accept herself as a Fae, which I find important. I mean, she doesn‚Äôt have much of a choice. She still has the attitude in her, but she has her badass moments.- Elain -Oh, man, It was heartbreaking to read about Elain and how she was handling things. I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it, really. It‚Äôs even worse when Lucien tries to interact with her with hardly any progress. In this book, Elain is stuck on Grayson. I mean, we know that isn‚Äôt going to happen anymore. But, it‚Äôs just sad. Again, with Lucien, I don‚Äôt think her story is finished. There are some unanswered questions. On a happier note, Elain learns to find her voice and her inner strength after what she went through. That made up for the rest of it.- Cassian -Oh, Cassian. He is still a smartass. But, something is definitely up with him here. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs because of Nesta and her ignorance of him. He tries to hide the fact it bothers him, but you can tell it really does. We also see Cassian‚Äôs bond with Rhysand and how strong it really is; their fear of losing each other in this war. Cassian definitely wants to prove himself in this war and we see that, but some of the scenes were scary. Not sinister or anything. But, as a reader, you are very scared and worried something bad will happen to him. I‚Äôll stop there, for your sake.I‚Äôm combining a few other characters together for one reason:- Amren, Azriel, Mor, Tamlin -Why are these characters combined? Well, let‚Äôs start with Amren. We only see Amren when she is helping Nesta and her connection with the Cauldron. There is a scene of betrayal, sort of. But, besides her AMAZING ending, she doesn‚Äôt feature that much.Azriel is kind of the same. He felt too much like a background character for me and, though there are scenes where you pray for him as you keep reading, I wish he was featured more. I don‚Äôt think he got much closure either.Which brings me to Mor. Oh man, we have a bombshell with her. I won‚Äôt reveal that, though. But, I wlll say her lack of closure goes with Azriel.Tamlin, Tamlin. I hate him, but I kind of don‚Äôt after reading this book. He spends most of the time just being pissy about what Feyre did, making innuendo jokes to get a rise, and just acting like a fifteen year old. However, there are moments where it seems he wants some kind of redemption or something. I will say that I do think he is still in love with Feyre, but I think his story is at an end. The closure is definitely there and hopefully he will find his own happiness.I want to reiterate that these opinions are my own opinions and how I felt about the book.Regardless of some of the negative opinions, I am still giving this book five stars. This book had me on edge and I‚Äôm glad but sad that this is the last full novel. Unless the book Gods and Sarah want to bless us with another full novel that isn‚Äôt a novella or something. I‚Äôm still praying.If you haven‚Äôt read this book because you are scared, don‚Äôt let that stop you. I was scared the whole way and I kept reading. I am very happy with this book and I loved entering this world again. This will probably be a series that I will definitely reread. That doesn‚Äôt happen often.Bottom line: You‚Äôll always be wanting more of Feyre‚Äôs story.",TRUE,30-05-2017,"Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2017",1635575605
794,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 3)",Best Read of 2017!,Amazon Customer,5,"‚ÄúWhen you erupt, girl, make sure it is felt across worlds.‚ÄùI seriously have no idea where to even begin with this review. I'm going to try not to include any spoilers, but if there are any, I'll give you fair warning before reading further. Honestly, I am absolutely blown away by this novel and it took me several days to adjust to the world after finishing this beautiful book. I honestly don't know how SJM can top this book, but let's get real here...she will because she's just that amazing. I read this in one sitting overnight because I simply couldn't put it down. It's true, this book is a Court of Pain and Feels but it is absolutely mindblowing and I felt incomplete after finishing. SJM seriously took her writing to new heights, and I can't even begin to explain how fantastic it was to experience this journey.‚ÄúThe great joy and honour of my life has been to know you. To call you my family. And I am grateful - more than I can possibly say - that I was given this time with you all.‚ÄùI have been such a fan of this series from the very beginning because I always felt that it showed Sarah J. Maas' extreme writing talent. It's so different from the Throne of Glass series, and I loved the creativity and dedication that she puts into this story. You can clearly tell just how much all of these characters mean to her, and every scene is richly described. Her writing truly sweeps you away and it's something that you easily lose yourself in. I know that if someone would ask me tomorrow to leave this world behind and instead go into Feyre's world, I would not even hesitate. This story is complex and I never expected for SJM to build on the world so much more than previously, but she does, and it's excellent. There is a great progression to the story, and this means new faces and new places come into play all while still developing our beloved characters.‚ÄúWhat we think to be our greatest weakness can sometimes be our biggest strength.‚ÄùThe book starts with Feyre back in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While some people might have found this part slow, I think it showcased just how far Feyre has come as a character. The strength that it took to go back and set the foundation for her (and Rhysand's) plot was utterly fantastic! I think it helped set up the story perfectly and it showed us Feyre's mindset at the time. I definitely got some Aelin feels in this part because of how awesome and kickass Feyre was, which just added to my love for her character. But the best thing: Feyre's characterization. I thought she was well-developed already, but SJM added yet another layer to her character. Feyre is such a strong and powerful character and has come such a long way since the first book. Looking back, I can't even believe that this is the same person...and that is an excellent thing. It shows how much Rhys and the Night Court have impacted her and aided her in the person she was to ultimately become.‚ÄúI would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years. And if this was all the time we were allowed to have... the wait was worth it.‚ÄùRhys is as perfect as ever. I mean come on...who doesn't love him?! The way he treats Feyre made me swoon every darn time, and she is his High Lady in every single way. He gives her something that Tamlin never did...respect. He believes in her and that she can accomplish amazing thing. He allows her to spread her wings (<-- this is an excellent pun btw...I know I'm really not as funny as I think) and embrace her magic. The constant support and love Rhys shows her is something every girl should have. Plus, he's freaking hilarious...you can't get a better man! I honestly will never get enough of him and he will always stay firmly in my top 5 book boyfriends. Obviously the chemistry between Feyre and Rhys is off the charts, and all the sex scenes are perfectly written. I love them together so much, it just makes my heart happy.‚ÄúIt's a rare person to face who they are and not run from it - not be broken by it.‚ÄùCassian and Nesta are brilliant and I firmly believe that they will be a focus in one of the upcoming books. I need them together, and I need to have a book with them as the main characters because it will be such an epic story! They have the perfect dynamic that is present throughout the entire book. We learn more about Mor, and my heart broke for her multiple times. I just wanted to give her a giant hug, but I loved delving deeper into her character. Azriel is brooding as ever, but I love him. There is definitely something up with him and Elain, and I need to know what that something is. Amren's sass is pure gold and I love her so much. There are definitely some surprises with her character that left me (along with the characters) shocked. We also meet a new High Lord, Helion and god do I love him! He has to be in these next 3 books because he's awesome. We also see the return of the Bone Carver and the Suriel. And seriously...they play epic roles in the story. And Tamlin...I have to mention this guy. I actually liked how SJM handled him in this book (especially at the end). It was realistic and believable. And (Lord help me), I didn't hate him anymore.‚ÄúMy rage had become a living thing inside my chest, an echoing heartbeat that soothed me to sleep and stirred me to waking.‚ÄùMy favorite part about this book though (besides all the other stuff) is its unpredictability. Seriously, SJM gave me a heart attack multiple times. Just when I thought the story was going in one direction and bombshell twist would come out of nowhere and completely change the entire story. And there was not 1, not 2, but 3 major things at the end in which I was freaking out and making very weird noises that I'm sure my neighbors in my apartment building did not appreciate. The one MAJOR (and I mean MAJOR) thing involving a certain character at the end had me with tears in my eyes and my face the picture of shock. I seriously have never been more scared for a character in my life, and I was praying so hard that SJM didn't do what she did. I think I stopped breathing at one point, so HOW DARE YOU SARAH J MAAS!! HOW DARE YOU SCARE ME LIKE THAT!‚ÄúIt is a new world, and we must decide how we are to end this old one and begin it anew.‚ÄùIf you couldn't tell, I LOVED this book! I still am not okay after reading the entire battle since SJM made me lose my mind, but everything was tied up nicely and the conclusion was everything I could want. Most of the main questions were answered, but she definitely planted the seeds for a new foe for our group to be facing. I think it would be interesting if the books were from different characters' perspectives, but I'm never going to mind more Feyre and Rhys.

I enjoyed the shift away from deep character development and relationship building toward more political intrigue and solidifying of the world around us.Book three allows us to deepen our already established views of the characters and their relationships, continue to understand the world, while expanding on the larger picture. While we danced with these political issues in the past books, it was a wonderful treat to focus on something new for book three!In addition, we also get to meet new characters while learning about the connections and relationships between our old friends, as well as the new ones. While a lot of the character development felt halted as we built on the political intrigue, I did find myself expanding my thoughts and reconsidering character dynamics.<spoiler>This includes a bit of surprise for me as I started to feel a bit of sympathy for Tamlin and started to consider the trauma that led to his action.

796,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 3)","Soooo Sooooo, but not worth the hype for me",JJ,3,"I could go on for awhile on this but I wont. I will probably not finish the next in the series.The first book was 4.5 stars, then the second was 4, and this was 3, maybe even 2.5. Why low stars? So many reasons, but really it was how i felt after finishing the book: relieved i was done.Rhys and Feyre....So I originally loved them together. They were hot and kept you on your toes. Then they happen in this book and it's boring and cheesy and bland and just plain cringy. Rhys turns into some doe eyed, teary, emotional and not at all bad@ss Fae, like he's originally portrayed. Instead he's the sacrificial lamb he has pined to be, over and over. And we hear about it constantly. 'Oh Rhys, you sacrificed so much for us! Let us repay you!' Rinse, repeat, again and again.Some more examples of constant rinse and repeat? ""This is your choice Feyre, we are a team, i will never take your choice away."" Take that passive aggressiveness Tamlin!! Oh wait, nope, just the reader gets to take it, over and over and over....each and every time the author reminds us of FEYRE's choice!!!!!Lets talk Tamlin shall we. Feyre did him dirty. I know I know, Im SURE Im in the minority here. But it just aggravates me when the whole point of contention in books is boiled down to a simple lack of communication. And that really was all it was. She fell out of love, moved on, but no one really told Tamlin! So he went under the wrong assumptions for so long. It really was aggravating. He was kind to her and truly loved her. Sure, he eventually said some terrible things to her. But a man scorned he was!! And really, if she was simply more upfront with him than her lousy letter, 'i wish you well' or something dumb like that, I wouldnt be all up in arms about it!The book is LONG. Very long. And yet we get nothing of Lucian and his new mate. Like nothing. They still have only had maybe 2 whole sentences between each other by the end of this 700+ page book. So I have no idea if they are even covered in the other books.Now dont think i forgot Nesta. Ugh I wish i would. Shes a raging B, pretty much 99% of the book. It gets old real fast. Yet she's written like a hero to save their day! She's written essentially: oh, she has problems with dealing with things and expressing her emotions well, so it's ok she treats everyone else like trash. She has an excuse. ....I hate that shiz. Just because you are sad or mad or hurting, does not give you the right to hurt others. Nesta says to Feyre, 'why didnt you tell us you couldnt read, i did not now and would have helped you.' Yeah, sure B. You treated Feyre like a sack of doo doo, and never truly worried about her when she was dangerously hunting for the family, or freezing to death or whatever other sacrifices Feyre made while you never.once.said.thanks! So no, Nesta gets no free pass from me. She never once redeemed herself in this book and I am only sorry Cassian is stuck with her frozen hearted soul.The whole Mor and Azrial thing. Sad. Like why make us think one thing, only to make it sooo much less fulfilling. I loved Azrial, and his soft spoken, loyal soul. Only to have to deal with whatever the heck Mor has going on. Talk about stringing someone along for.....zillions of years.Just disappointed with this book. When i invested so much time, i expected a bit more i suppose. Don't get me wrong.

798,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 3)",Fast paced and addictive,Melissa Mitchell,5,"(5/5‚≠êÔ∏è) ‚ÄúMy rage had become a living thing inside my chest, an echoing heartbeat that soothed me to sleep and stirred me to waking.‚Äù ‚ÄîSarah J MaasFeyre is ready to fight in this final installment of the ACOTAR trilogy (not counting the novella). Having failed to damage the cauldron in ACOMAF, Feyre is taken into the Spring Court under the guise of having been brainwashed. Tamlin believes her leaving him was all Rhysand‚Äôs doing. She encourages this misbelief, determined to rip apart Tamlin‚Äôs court from the inside. Meanwhile, the King of Hybern is done staging his troops for war. He‚Äôs ready to bring Prythian to its knees. He plans to strike hard at the wall, then sweep across the land and take all the courts. The only way to stop him is to unite all the High Lords, and even then it might not be enough. It will take something short of a miracle to bring him down. But the world has some unexpected allies in the form of monsters. It also has Feyre, Amren, Nesta and Elain. These strong women are unlike others for more than one reason, but especially because they are ‚Äúmade.‚Äù They just might have what it takes to save everyone, even if it kills them.Crying!!!! I‚Äôm CRYING. Or I was. I don‚Äôt remember the last time I cried so much in a book. Happy tears. Sad tears. Sometimes I was just crying because of how emotional this book made me. Like Rhysand‚Äôs little circle up before the final battle (which reminded me a lot of the final battle in LOTR btw). Rhysand‚Äôs words to all his friends. This might be the last time they are all together. That was all I could think as tears washed down my face. As a sense of foreboding and fear settled over me. Deep down I was thinking, SJM wouldn‚Äôt DARE kill ANY of them...right?!...right?!‚ÄúI believe everything happens for a reason. Whether it is decided by the Mother, or the Cauldron, or some sort of tapestry of Fate, I don't know. I don't really care. But I am grateful for it, whatever it is. Grateful that it brought you all into my life. If it hadn't... I might have become as awful as that prick we're going to face today.‚ÄùThe plot in this book was faster paced than ACOMAF. A lot faster. Everything happens in rapid succession. There‚Äôs NO time to catch your breath. Feyre is in Spring Court for the first part, bringing it down, and then running for her life, and there‚Äôs the meeting of the High Lords‚Äîwhich was OMG, tense‚Äîand the attack at the library, all the battles. You get the picture. It‚Äôs GO GO GO.In terms of world building, SJM really tied things off nicely. I loved her introduction of some of the monsters, giving us an even deeper glimpse into Prythian. Like the use of the Weaver, the Bone Carver, and the creature from the depths of the library for the war. We got to see all the High Lords together. We got to see more magic. Everything was brought to a nice close in that regard.There was still PLENTY of romance, and hints of new romance to come, like Cassian and Nesta (SO excited for their upcoming novella), and Elain and Lucian...? If that ever happens.‚ÄúNesta looked at the king with death twining around his hands, then down at Cassian. And covered Cassian‚Äôs body with her own. Cassian went still - then his hand slid over her back. Together. They‚Äôd go together.‚ÄùI really liked the way Rhysand and Feyre‚Äôs relationship strengthened, too. That he trusted her with things as dangerous as sneaking in to the King of Hybern‚Äôs camp to rescue her sister spoke VOLUMES:‚ÄúYou do not fear. You do not falter. You do not yield. You go in, you get her, and you come out again.‚ÄùWOW. That quote though. Those two are my favorite bookish couple of ALL TIME. Hands down. He could have insisted on doing it himself. Or even sending someone else. But he trusted Feyre because she was confident that she could succeed.In terms of character development, where the last book was Feyre healing, I felt this book was her coming into her own. She really learned how to take matters into her own hands, how to be strong, how to make her own decisions. She definitely did some growing, with Rhysand‚Äôs encouragement no less. She looked into the mirror and saw who she really was, and she accepted that.The other character arc that stood out to me was Tamlin‚Äôs, even though it happened mostly in the background. He went from feeling he owned Feyre, to finally accepting that she wasn‚Äôt his, but even more: he saved her life. That, in my eyes, fully redeemed him. I still find fault with him, and he‚Äôs not my favorite, BUT he saved her life.The ending was a little surprising but very satisfying for me. I really didn‚Äôt expect Amarin to come back, but she did and I‚Äôm happier for it. I liked that she came back changed. And...Rhysand dying? That was...I‚Äôm not sure. At first I thought it was unnecessary, but the more I think about it, I think it was necessary BECAUSE we needed Tamlin to be the final say in the matter. We needed that final acorn of life from him. We NEEDED to see that Tamlin had FINALLY accepted Feyre‚Äôs choice. That he would rather see Feyre happy, even if it meant he couldn‚Äôt have her. That, to me, tied off his character arc nicely.This series has become my absolute favorite. I say that about a lot of books, but there‚Äôs no question here. I recommend it to everyone who loves darker fantasy, political intrigue, strong female leads, sexy fae...you name it! I am glad there are two novellas for me to read soon. One I have and will get to soon, the other coming in January (YESSS). So...go read this series!",TRUE,22-07-2020,"Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2020",1635575605
799,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 3)",The Story and Writing Are Superb,Alexandria Woods,5,"*****Spoilers*****A fantastic written work! I am a sucker for happy endings, well mostly a happy ending anyway, at least in this book. Feyre and Rhys and crew jetting off constantly to face danger and war and try to make their world a better place. They accomplished much and have the makings for the peace and unity they crave so hopefully things will go well if there's another book to this series.I did not like Feyre's plan or execution of her plan to deceive Tamlin. Faking her feelings to get out from under Hybern was prudent in the moment but when she went back to the Spring court and sowed discontent and disrupted the trust Tamlin's court had in him, I was let down. Especially since Tamlin's actions at the time were in an attempt to save Feyre, misguided though his goals were. I'd have much preferred if Feyre disappeared from Spring again after talking to Tamlin. Too, I never really bought into Feyre's hatred of Tamlin. Yes he stifled her and locked her in his house with wards up and it was devastating after her stay under the mountain but it wasn't so egregious in my opinion to garner such strong dislike from Feyre. Tamlin loses her and Lucian from his court at the same time in a nest of King Hybern's goals. It's just that much sadder to find that Tamlin was trying to fight against the King through the keeping his enemies close adage. And he comes through for her in the end when she and Azriel go to that enemy camp to save her sister Elain. My hope would be that Tamlin finds himself a mate down the line, he's been battered enough, I think.Rhys. Oh Rhys. I liked him under the mountain when he was bad but knowing the truth behind the mask is perfect too. He makes mistakes but his heart is in the right place and his selflessness and attempts to shield others so takes more on himself in sacrifice of everything he has and is breaks me when he dies putting it into repairing the cauldron. Thankfully the other High Lords survive the battlefield and give them his essence plus Fayre so that he's resurrected. I wouldn't have liked the outcome had he remained dead but it does make me wonder if it would work for all of the other High Lords? And what that knowledge will mean in future for the courts.Thank you for FINALLY revealing the story behind Mor's inability to love Azriel the way he desires. The next step is for her to actually tell him that she prefers women. I like Azriel the best and he should hear what she says so that he can move on fully, I think. I also want Mor to be happy with whoever she chooses without fear of what others think. It's curious though that Mor has her sexuality hanging over her head when one of the high lords has a same sex mate. Makes no sense.Cassian and Nesta have the beginnings of something, if she'll allow it. The care is evident between them but after the final battle, she seemed to withdraw instead of move forward on what they were building together. Her desperate cries for him on the battlefield saved his life so I'd think she'd be loathe to waste more time.Amsen was a surprise. I didn't realize what she was doing when she slammed the book shut just after Fayre touched the cauldron but no way did I ever think Amsen was a traitor. Tricks up her sleeve she had but my thought was that she and Nesta had figured it out and Nesta would have to be the sacrifice, especially since Nesta was the most connected to the cauldron. Amsen sacrificed herself but again, she was brought back by Rhys. No longer otherworldly, just high fae but she's there in the end and hopefully can build something with Varian.Lucian has almost no role in this book which I thought was disappointing but it was cute seeing his reactions to and around Elain. He's so careful and considerate and clearly wants the bond but is being patient. Wish them both happiness in whatever future they have but I think it'll be a while for Elain. She's still clearly devastated by her mortal mate Greyson's reaction to her fae transformation. It was incongruous that the gentle son (as previously portrayed) was more harsh and unforgiving than his father (who had been portrayed as just that intolerant of fae). Elain is almost child-like in this book and doesn't interact much with everyone else. I forgot about her until the cauldron snatched her away. That she was the one who stabbed King Haybern wasn't a surprise to me but given her nature to that point, I'm glad she seemed to take something of herself back.Outside of Rhys, my favorite high lord was Helion. Can't put a finger on exactly why but maybe because I sense he needs something more to his life. That he's probably Lucian's father was a revelation that was a shock but I wished Feyre or someone had told them both. Lucian's mother loves Helion but is married to Baron whom his son Eris is plotting to kill. I'm not sure what that would then mean for his mother and Helion but only time will tell if there are more books written.",TRUE,10-09-2020,"Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2020",1635575605

830,The Coworker,A great twisty psychological thriller!,Sharon,4,"I love Freida McFadden‚Äôs writing; she always keeps me guessing. And her newest book, The Coworker, is no exception.Natalie Farrell is a sales Representative and Dawn Schiff is an accountant at Vixed, a nutritional supplement company. Natalie is beautiful and popular, and everything seems to come so easily for her. Dawn is the complete opposite, she is socially awkward, plain looking and her only real friend is her childhood best friend, Mia. They do have one thing in common though, they both have dark secrets. When Dawn goes missing, Natalie finds herself in the middle and her perfect life is blown apart.Dawn is always at her desk at 8:45am sharp. So, when Natalie showed up to work at 9:00 and Dawn was not at her desk, she stopped and did a double take. Where is Dawn? She is always on time and has never taken a sick day. No one else in the office is all that concerned that Dawn is not in, but Natalie cannot shake the feeling that something is wrong. When the phone on Dawn‚Äôs desk rings, Natalie answers it and the voice on the other end sounds like Dawn and she whispers, ‚Äúhelp me‚Äù. Natalie takes it upon herself to drive to Dawn‚Äôs house and check on her. When she enters Dawn‚Äôs house through the unlocked back door, Natalie is shocked by what she sees. Dawn‚Äôs living room is covered in blood, but Dawn is nowhere to be found. When the police start their investigation, they uncover information that makes them set their sights on Natalie. Natalie is now in a cat and mouse game, and she must find out what happened to Dawn and why someone is framing her.I cannot say too much about what happens because I think it is best to go into this book blind. But I will say I wasn‚Äôt sure who to believe or trust while I was reading. At first, I liked Natalie because she came across as such a nice person. Every year she has a charity 5K run event to help raise funds for Muscular Dystrophy, in honor of her friend she lost to the disease. Natalie also always seemed to go out of her way to be nice to Dawn, though they were not best friends, Natalie considered Dawn to be a friend. But then we get Dawn‚Äôs POV via emails she sent to her childhood best friend, Mia. In these emails Natalie comes across as a very different person, according to Dawn, Natalie was a bully. I loved getting these two sides because it made both Natalie and Dawn unreliable characters.The Coworker was full of so many twists and turns. Just when I thought I may know what was going on, a twist would come and point me in another direction. So many times I found my jaw drop and would be like ‚ÄòWhat?!‚Äù. If you are looking for a twisty psychological thriller, then I definitely recommend Freida McFadden‚Äôs The Coworker.",TRUE,22-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2023",172829620X
831,The Coworker,Devious and Deadly Drama,Susan M. Baumann,4,"This is the second of McFadden‚Äôs books that I‚Äôve read. McFadden does create significant suspense in this story, and I wanted to find out how it would end. I figured out a portion of the plot beforehand, but was still anxious to see what would happen next.Natalie and Dawn are polar opposites. Natalie is blonde, vivacious, extroverted and successful.She‚Äôs a hard-charging sales rep for a Boston-based health supplement company. She‚Äôs well-liked, motivated and used to getting what she wants.In contrast, Dawn is quiet, reserved, shy and more-than-a-little quirky. She‚Äôs rigidly punctual, socially awkward and desperately eager to connect with her coworkers, often with disastrous results. She‚Äôs a dedicated accountant at the same company as Natalie, but she exists in the background and on the sidelines.Then one day, Dawn doesn‚Äôt show up for work.This wouldn‚Äôt be particularly unusual for a typical employee, but it‚Äôs definitely out of character for Dawn, whose schedule is consistent and unwavering. While out on a sales call, Natalie impulsively decides to go to Dawn‚Äôs home to check on her, and to see if anything is amiss. Natalie enters through an unlocked back door and finds a large bloodstain on the living room carpet. Shaken, she calls the police.An investigation begins that centers around Dawn‚Äôs various colleagues because she seemed to have few friends and little family.The assigned detective pursues various leads, but increasingly circles back to Natalie and her possible involvement. Natalie‚Äôs puzzled and then fearful when she becomes the central focus and primary suspect in the investigation, when the battered body of an unidentified woman is found.The story moves between the search for Dawn and Natalie‚Äôs racheting alarm at the mounting evidence against her. She worries that someone is trying to frame her for murder, and watches helplessly as former friends turn against her. McFadden does an excellent job at depicting the juxtaposition of the two women‚Äôs lives as they intersect and unravel. Lots of adrenaline and pages turning in a flurry. I was surprised by how invested I was, given my earlier reaction to McFadden‚Äôs other book, ‚ÄúNever Lie‚Äù. This one had a slightly more redemptive message, though the darker undertones are still ever-present in this book as well. McFadden seems to favor shady characters with sinister edges, complicated backstories and subjective motivations. As a thriller, it works, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to encounter people like this in real life.",TRUE,20-09-2023,"Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2023",172829620X
832,The Coworker,Slow burn üî• but worth it!,Xavier F. Martinez,4,"So, at first, it seemed rather pedestrian, but still got my attention. THEN, the more I read I could make connections between the characters and people I actually work with. That‚Äôs when I knew I was hooked!While you may get thrown off by parts of the story being told via emails between characters, it‚Äôs a plot devise that makes sense once you get 3/4 through the story. Similar to the use of newspaper articles and such telling you the story of what happened at the prom in Stephen King‚Äôs ‚ÄúCarrie.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs all I will say here.Once again, I got caught up in the emotional drama of the main characters, that I missed the clues that were right there in front of me.This is definitely an easy read, but it is engrossing and a fun way to spend the weekend, when the weather is crappy and you‚Äôre having a cup of coffee or chocolate, and need a good book to get you through. Yup, it‚Äôs a page turner, and a fun roller-coaster ride, if you stick with it.You will enjoy the fact that the protagonists are also antagonists and need each other to get out of the mess they created.

Ever so meticulous and methodically predictable, Natalie is worried about her and goes to their boss to explain that Dawn is missing. Seth, their boss, doesn't seem too upset - and says she will be along shortly, not thinking anything is wrong. Until Natalie goes back to her desk and hears Dawns phone ringing in her cubicle. Unaware, she picks up the phone to hear a meek ""Help me,"" and the caller hangs up. Could Dawn be in trouble? It's only then that Natalie begins down a dark web of mystery, full of lies, deceit, and even a case of manipulation and possibly.... murder?",TRUE,27-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2023",172829620X

840,Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!,"Empowering Financial Wisdom - ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" is a Must-Read!",Online Gourmet,5,"""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" by Robert Kiyosaki is an extraordinary book that has truly changed my perspective on money, wealth, and financial literacy. This insightful and empowering read presents invaluable lessons that the rich teach their children about money, contrasting it with the mindset and beliefs commonly held by the poor and middle class.

Through relatable stories and personal experiences, Kiyosaki challenges conventional beliefs about money and unveils the fundamental principles of financial success. He emphasizes the importance of financial education, investment strategies, and building assets to create lasting wealth. These powerful lessons have inspired me to take control of my financial journey and make better choices for a prosperous future.The storytelling approach used in this book is exceptional. Kiyosaki narrates his childhood experiences, highlighting the contrasting financial mindsets of his own ""poor dad"" (his biological father) and his ""rich dad"" (his friend's father). This storytelling style effectively communicates complex financial concepts in a relatable and engaging manner. It makes the book accessible to readers from all walks of life, regardless of their prior financial knowledge.The practicality of the lessons presented in ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" is noteworthy.

Kiyosaki stresses the importance of acquiring financial knowledge and understanding the different forms of income, assets, and liabilities. This focus on education empowers readers to make informed financial decisions and take control of their financial destinies. It serves as a wake-up call to the significance of financial literacy in achieving long-term wealth and financial security.The impact of ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" extends beyond personal finance. It challenges societal norms and encourages readers to question the traditional path of education and employment. Kiyosaki promotes entrepreneurship and encourages individuals to think outside the box, take calculated risks, and embrace the opportunities that come with financial independence. This book has the potential to reshape one's mindset and open up a world of possibilities.Lastly, I must commend the author for his ability to inspire and motivate readers. Kiyosaki's writing style is engaging, passionate, and thought-provoking. His genuine desire to empower others to achieve financial success shines through every page, making ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" a truly transformative reading experience.In conclusion, ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" is a must-read for anyone seeking to gain financial knowledge, reshape their mindset, and create a solid foundation for long-term wealth.

As I had originals read these books with my daughter, it was not on the top of list of things to pay attention to. My Daughter who counted herself a daughter of Apollo, lived an breathed this story when she was in grade school. I have so many wonderful memories of sitting and talking with her. Going over the adventures and how she would feel in the various situations. As my daughter is now 23 and I often miss her being young, this book is an amazing reminder to embrace all stages of life. I look forward to reading the last 2 books, feeling nostalgia for the time past and approaching the future as an adventure.",TRUE,19-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2023",1368098177
851,Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Chalice of the Gods (Percy Jackson & the Olympians),childhood throwback,Luz J,5,"This book brought me back to a time when things were a little easier, and I was first dipping my toes into actually reading novels instead of flipping through picture books.I won‚Äôt give too much away, but as I was reading through some pages, I realized that a lot of the scenes in the book were vaguely familiar. It didn‚Äôt take me long to realize that this book resembled the first Percy Jackson book‚ÄîThe Lightning Thief.Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a different book entirely, and it stands on its own pretty well, but it definitely has a similar spark to the first one. As I was reading through it, I felt like a kid again, cracking open the first book after getting my hands on the whole set from a scholastic book fair catalog order I had placed with my literature teacher.With that said, I couldn‚Äôt put the book down. It was a quick read, but delightful nonetheless.

(If you‚Äôre NOT a regular reader, why not?) There is less action than usual, but the snarky asides from the narrator (the ever reliable Percy Jackson) are definitely present, full humour quotient in place.But What The Hell is up with the changing fonts every few words??? From serif to non-serif and back and forth again and again. There are few things as annoying in a novel than anomalies that pull the reader out of the story, and this font switching is high on the annoyance list. If these were to stress some words, as seems to be the case in some instances, why not use italics in the common manner? This font thing is unacceptable!Or is this a problem in the formatting when uploading the digital version? If that‚Äôs the issue, for the sake of all the gods fix it and fix it now.

853,Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Chalice of the Gods (Percy Jackson & the Olympians),Nostalgia and a nice warm Olympian blanket,Akys,5,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW: I enjoyed every page. This book was completely full of classic Riordan-charm, and brought me right back to when I first opened The Lightning Thief.In this book, Percy reflects on what his life might look like beyond the dangers of being a teenage Demigod, and in this, offers us readers a chance to reflect on who we were when we first discovered PJO, and who we are becoming today. Riordan navigated this parallel with brilliant ease.My *only* sticking point is, It did not feel like an ending to a two decade adventure‚Äîit feels like the first book of a new trilogy. And, being only 268 pages, it was significantly shorter than most of the books in this universe, so I finished the book happy, but ultimately craving more.",TRUE,03-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 3, 2023",1368098177

878,First Little Readers Parent Pack: Guided Reading Level A: 25 Irresistible Books That Are Just the Right Level for Beginning Readers,Excellent books for beginning readers!,Theresa King,5,"I ordered all 3 sets of these books for my Kindergartner. He already recognizes a bunch of sight words and I wanted to get a great collection of books that would give him lots of practice and lots of success! I taught reading enrichment classes to early readers for ~9 years, so I knew what I was looking for; these are perfect for getting a youngster started!Another reviewer complained that the sets did not differ in difficulty from A to B to C, but I have to disagree. In my picture, a book from set A is at the top, set B in the middle, and set C at the bottom. All three are alike in their simple sentence structure, but there are key differences. Set A books use a very short sentence, usually with only one word changing per page. This lets the child read independently, recognizing the pattern and using visual clues to figure out unknown words, thereby experiencing a lot of success and feeling pride in their reading skills. Set B uses slightly longer sentences or even two sentences per page, and the words that change frequently have more syllables. The pictures still help with figuring it out, though, so your child can move through the text comfortably, learning to not be intimidated by long words (very important!). Set C books seem to focus on words that have challenging phonics elements (like ""grew"" -- not an easy word to sound out until you've learned that digraph, which usually happens sometime in mid 1st grade) or longer and more diverse sentences with multi-syllabic words. Don't get me wrong; these books are little half steps in the reading process and are all early-mid Kindergarten level, but in setting up your child for success -- giving them confidence and the willingness to try -- these early experiences are crucial! I am very pleased with the purchase and am excited for my kid to try them.UPDATE 10/1/21 -- I will modify my above statement for at least one of the books. In the A set, there is a book called ""Almost Spring"" that I feel belongs in set B or possibly even set C. It uses the present participle (-ing) on almost every page, and while a child at this level may know or be able to figure out the root word (for instance, ""melt"" or ""peep""), they are very likely to be thrown by ""melting"" and ""peeping."" Just remember to give your child lots of support and encouragement when they read, and if they seem to be struggling, just tell them the word and let them move on. :)P.S.

887,Hatchet,Wisdom in the wilderness,LA in Dallas,5,"I read Hatchet for the first time many years ago -- probably 1988, when it became a Newbery Honor book. Not all Newbery books are great, but this one was. Being reminded of it recently, I noticed that it is the first book of a series of five, most of which I have never read, so I decided to go back to it.Hatchet is the story of thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson. Brian sets off as a passenger in a single-engine bush plane to visit his father in northern Canada. On the way, the pilot dies in a heart attack. Brian, whom the pilot had been showing how to fly the plane before his heart attack, manages to crash the plane in a lake in the forest. He survives the crash, but then has the problem of surviving until he is rescued. He DOES survive (not a spoiler, since the publisher's blurb tells us that this is a ""story of survival"").You would naturally imagine this to be an action-packed story, but it really is not. There are a few exciting moments, most conspicuously the crash and the tornado (also mentioned in the blurb). It is mostly about Brian figuring out how to survive -- how to feed himself and remain safe from danger. And survival, it turns out, depends on wisdom. Brian learns to see the wild world he inhabits and to know its meanings. I am tempted to say that Brian becomes wise, but I think that's unfair to him. Brian was wise, but his wisdom needed to be brought to the fore.In an epilog, Gary Paulsen tells us that Brian is forever changed by this experience.""When the pilot rescued Brian he had been alone on the L-shaped lake for fifty-four days. During that time he had lost seventeen percent of his body weight. He later gained back six percent, but had virtually no body fat‚Äîhis body had consumed all extra weight and he would remain lean and wiry for several years.""Many of the changes would prove to be permanent. Brian had gained immensely in his ability to observe what was happening and react to it; that would last him all his life. He had become more thoughtful as well, and from that time on he would think slowly about something before speaking.""When I read that, I felt oddly envious. I caught myself wishing that something like this could happen to me. Of course, I don't really. I don't want to be trapped in the forests of northern Ontario for 8 weeks all on my own. I'm happy here with my books and movies and grocery stores and microwave oven. But, let us just say, Hatchet shows me something of what those cost me.Hatchet is brief -- about a two-hour read.

890,"The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder",An Extraordinary Tale.,Tom Weikert,5,"‚ÄúAs a tale gets passed from one person to another, it ripples out until it is as wide and mythic as the sea.‚ÄùThe annals of British naval history abound with great and small adventures alike. None, however, captivates like the extraordinary tale of the HMS Wager. And no one can better recount such a hair-raising series of events than David Grann. With ""The Wager,"" Grann tops his previous works of narrative nonfiction with this harrowing story of inconceivable hardship and the machinations of desperate men. To be sure, no incident contained in this book is without ample evidence proving it occurred.It is hard to imagine a more horrifying set of survival conditions than those faced by Wager's crew, and capturing those conditions accurately based on aging historical records and biased published accounts was undoubtedly tricky. Yet, Grann does yeoman's work on this story of the ill-fated Wager, part of a British squadron ordered to sea in August 1740 against the Spanish in the apocryphal ‚ÄúWar of Jenkins‚Äô Ear."" Commanding Wager and at the center of Grann's book is Captain David Cheap, a deeply flawed and complicated skipper.Like Grann's other books, ""The Wager"" nearly requires one to suspend disbelief. The author carefully and patiently reveals the story's events, shocking the reader in the process. Moreover, upon completing Grann's 257-page account of Wager's exploits and those of its sister ship, HMS Centurion, the reader better understands the ruthlessness and cunning demonstrated by the British Royal Navy as it navigated the high seas in quest of Empire. Indeed, British imperial ambitions are fully displayed in ""The Wager.""Based mainly on seamen‚Äôs logbooks and trial records, many of which are over 250 years old, Grann pieces together the seemingly doomed Wager‚Äôs calamities while providing ample historical context. The author, for example, details the multitudinous threats facing British ships as they pursued the Empire's aims in the mid-18th century. He also describes shipboard conditions on a British man-of-war sailing the world's oceans during this era.Wager meets its fate while searching for a Spanish galleon laden with treasure and attempting to negotiate the treacherous seas off Cape Horn at the tip of the South American continent. The crew, already decimated by storms, scurvy, and sundry other trials, finds its ship dashed on the rocks off the coast of Patagonia, Argentina. Marooned in May 1741 with little hope of rescue, the men struggle to survive on a scabrous spit of land subsequently named Wager Island.Malnourished and desperate, Wager‚Äôs surviving company suffers a complete breakdown in discipline and decorum. Having lost confidence in the ailing and unpredictable Cheap, still in command, the castaways defy British naval law and flout regulations. A fulminant Cheap, for his part, opposes the indiscipline and enforces his authority at the end of a pistol. A mutiny takes shape, and eventually, a breakaway faction, led by Gunner's Mate John Bulkeley, abandons Cheap and his loyalists, leaving them to fend for themselves on Wager Island. By this time, subsisting on the meagerest of diets harvested from terrain that barely sustains life while withstanding storm after storm, Cheap and crew somehow endure.Sailing a small transport boat reinforced with scrap lumber harvested from Wager and equipped with makeshift sails and rigging, Bulkeley and his charges successfully navigate the Strait of Magellan to Brazil. Meanwhile, Cheap and the Wager Island stragglers experience an equally implausible outcome. Sailing on an eighteen-foot yawl salvaged from the Wager, they set off to reach the Chilean coast. Surviving their respective ordeals, the two parties return to London, providing their lurid accounts of mutiny, betrayal, abandonment, and murder to an incredulous British Admiralty and fascinated public. They alternately face scorn and approbation and, eventually, court-martial.It is the Wager leadership‚Äôs trial for which Grann saves his best narration and jaw-dropping, surprise ending.""The Wager"" asks which of the stories is harder to believe: the death-defying travails and travels of these indomitable seamen or the unanticipated result as the British Admiralty adjudicates their fate. Yet, Grann provides the reader with all the evidence necessary to confirm these events happened irrefutably. Relying on an abundance of journals, logs, diaries, and even letters, Grann demonstrates again his seemingly unquenchable thirst for the truth to inform his audience. His single-spaced bibliography alone exceeds 13 pages.Without question, ""The Wager"" is an astonishing naval story reminiscent of Charles Nordhoff‚Äôs and James Norman Hall‚Äôs ‚ÄúMutiny on the Bounty.‚Äù Considering the inglorious actions of the Wager's crew, Grann's book is worth reading and rereading to comprehend the motives of desperate men. Experiencing the audacity and might of the 18th century British Royal Navy, particularly exemplified by Centurion as she squares off with the Spanish man-of-war Our Lady of Covadonga off the Philippines, provides immensely satisfying adventure reading.

What constitutes a ""BigDog"" book? It has to be the right combination of Information, Amusement and Never Being Able to Put it Down. David Grann did all three at a very high level. I think I love this guy, David Grann. He must have worked so damn hard on this book. The amount of scribbles and scrabbles he was probably trying to decipher from these dumb 250 year old ship logs! It must have been so tedious.But Grann did it. He went to work and researched the tits out of this story. And sure, there are certainly holes he must have approached in the story and realized that he would have to creatively fill those in. That, in my opinion, is to be expected. Not only did Grann fill those holes, he did it expertly and seamlessly. Do YOU know why we have the phrase ""3 Sheets To the Wind"" as a euphemism for being drunk? Well, throughout this history of the British man-o-wars, David Grann teaches you that there's more to being a shipman than knowing a few knots & phrases. It takes guts and sometimes, even honor.I won't spoil the story for you here. I believe the Amazon description above gives you even too much information and ""spoils"" as the kids say. Speaking of kids, my 14 year old son was watching me devour this book. He was the only one in my family willing to listen to the new things I'd learned about man-o-wars or ancient tribes while we all gathered at the dinner table. ""Did you know that the British Navy could just roll up on homies who had abandoned their ships and pretended to be dead so they didn't have to go back to sea? They called these guys 'Press Gangs.'"" Only my 14 year old would chirp up and say something positive like, ""That's awesome, dad!"" Or ""Do you think you could be a seaman, dad?"" What a nice boy.One day while I was cranking through the part of the book near the end that is sort of the political intrigue portion, my son said ""David Grann.""""What?"" I asked.""David Grann. The author."" My son was staring at the book jacket cover. ""I bet he's a real G.""I motioned for the kid to come over and when he sat next to me I said, ""A G? You better believe Grann is a G because he did all this freakin' research to make this book come to life. If that's not bein' a G, then I don't know what else is. Plus, take a look at this picture of him inside the book jacket!""He leaned in and looked at this picture of the most G-lookin dude of all time. David Grann, standing there with a polo shirt and jacket on top. Not really smiling, not really frowning. Just a look of a confident son of a bitch. My son was right: Grann is a real G. We looked at the picture and then my son read the little bio below, which is just his bonafides in the literary sense. We would have preferred David give us a little bit more personal stuff. For example, his favorite pizza topping would be a good choice to include. What about HIS favorite books instead of a list of books he wrote? I get it... his publisher only wants to pimp his books instead of other authors'. Still, give me a little flavor with Grann.Under his bio, there is his social media and website listed. Only his Twitter and Facebook handle. No instagram. I found that strange. You'd think there'd be a Wager Instagram handle at least! When I finished the book, I wanted to shout it out on my Instagram Story and let everyone know that David Grann is a G and he wrote a BigDog book. To my surprise, I found that Grann DID have an instagram page! I was shocked. Did one of his kids shame him into doing this? His publisher maybe? Regardless, my dude only has like 8 or 9 posts! And it's just pictures of the hardcopy of The Wager stacked on top of each other. I tagged this sad Instagram account to my hype Story about the book anyway.

892,"The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder",Grann's Gift as a Story-Teller on Full Display,Charles Salmans,5,"Grann‚Äôs Gift as a Story-Teller on Full DisplayIn the first half of the 18th century, Britain already had the most powerful navy in the world. But financing that navy was a huge burden on the Crown and England had not yet achieved the wealth that the industrial revolution and its own colonization efforts would later bring. The answer: intercept the gold and silver that Spanish ships were bringing home from its New World colonies.Author David Grann is able to tell not only this larger story but also to resurrect one of the most astonishing seafaring events of the time. A ship named ‚ÄúThe Wager‚Äù was to be part of a British fleet that would intercept gold-laden Spanish vessels in what was officially-sanctioned piracy. As the book‚Äôs cover indicates, what then transpired was shipwreck, mutiny and murder. This is also the story of unexpected survival and efforts in an Admiralty court back in England to establish the truth of what happened.Life on board a ship at the time, so full of danger and disease that it was not unusual for as few as ten percent of the crew to survive a long voyage, meant that the Royal Navy had great difficulty manning its ships. Grann provides graphic descriptions of able-bodied and not-so-able-bodied men being kidnapped off the wharfs (‚Äúimpressed‚Äù) to fill the complement of seamen just as a ship was about to sail. (Some years later the impressment of American seamen was a contributor to the War of 1812.)The hulls of wooden sailing ships had a very short life-span due to wood-eating worms, and were susceptible to leaks and other threats to seaworthiness. Scurvy could render entire crews incapable of functioning. Other communicable diseases could cause widespread death on board a crowded, ill-ventilated vessel.In the case of The Wager, the author was able to find a remarkable record of its 1740 voyage and of the events to come. This was in part due to the fact that on board as a junior officer was John Byron, a gentleman volunteer and a compulsive diarist. Incidentally, he was the grandfather of Lord Byron.Additionally, another major actor in the drama, John Bulkeley, had kept a voluminous diary which chronicled the events of the voyage. Buikeley held the position of Gunner, a crucial role in ship combat, and had many other responsibilities on board. He was an instinctive leader, physically imposing, who commanded respect.Finally, there was the record of the court-martial proceedings themselves, in which the main actors including David Cheap, the captain, provided their own version of events. Cheap was an ambitious, younger son of a Scottish Laird who, under the rules of primogeniture, did not inherit his father‚Äôs estate. He ran off to sea at 17 and set his sights on becoming a captain, which he realized when an opening occurred on The Wager.The Wager survived the perilous passage around the treacherous Cape Horn, only to run aground and break up on the rocks of an uninhabited island off Patagonia. There were no animals or other significant source of food on the island. The crew soon divided into two factions, one supporting Captain Cheap who wanted to build a vessel out of timbers salvaged from the shipwreck and continue up the Pacific coast of South America to engage Spanish ships. The other group was led by Buckeley, who wanted to build a vessel to return to England. The situation was so dire it would seem impossible that either group would survive.Improbably a few men did make their way back to England to be hailed as heroes. That is, until a second group, including Captain Cheap, also arrived. This forms the final chapter of the story of The Wager and the launch of an inquiry to establish the truth.Faced by death by hanging if they were found guilty of mutiny or of discipline if they failed their duty, each survivor told his story. ‚ÄúMembers of the Admiralty found themselves confounded by competing versions of events,‚Äù the author tells us. The result was unexpected, but only if one fails to consider that the leaders of an institution, in this case the Royal Navy, have as their first priority the preservation of that institution and the protection of its reputation.This is a wonderfully-written book and Grann is a masterful story teller.",TRUE,16-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2023",385534264
893,"The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder","Astonishing tale of castaways battling the elements, starvation, and ultimately each other.",Colonel D,4,"I‚Äôm a fan of books about the age of sail, either fiction or non-fiction and ‚ÄúThe Wager‚Äù was an easy title to choose given the subject matter. In 1740 a Royal Navy squadron sets off on a secret mission to track down and capture a treasure laden Spanish galleon. While attempting to navigate the treacherous Cape Horn passage the HMS Wager is wrecked in severe weather off a desolate island on the Patagonian coast. What ensues is an astonishing tale of the marooned crew battling the harsh elements, starvation, and ultimately each other. Remarkably some of them survive and return to England with conflicting accounts of exactly happened to the ill-fated crew of the Wager. You have to admire the courage, tenacity, grit, and perseverance of individuals confronting such extreme adversity. Even the basic act of going to sea back then for months or years at a time required someone with exceptional intestinal fortitude. The skills and knowledge needed in those days to maneuver and navigate these complex sailing ships was considerable while bringing them into battle and defeating the enemy meant having a leader of incredible ability and luck. David Grann‚Äôs telling of the fate of ‚ÄúThe Wager‚Äù and her crew is masterfully done and hard to put down. The author meticulously researched this book and the amount of care he put into this work is obvious. For those who don‚Äôt think they like reading ‚Äòhistory books‚Äô I‚Äôd suggest trying ‚ÄúThe Wager‚Äù because once you get sucked into the narrative you‚Äôll be turning the pages to find out what happens next to these unfortunate castaways. I‚Äôm not sure what to make about some of the negative reviews I read here about the ‚Äúlack of dialog‚Äù‚Ä¶this isn‚Äôt a novel and there aren‚Äôt any actual recordings of conversations that could be included. It‚Äôs like complaining that there aren‚Äôt any photos in the Bible. As a side note visiting an actual sailing ship of the era is an educational experience. The USS Constitution in Boston or the whaler Charles W. Morgan in Mystic, Connecticut gives you an idea of the conditions sailors like the ones on HMS Wager had to live with. If in the U.K. then a trip to Portsmouth (where our story begins) is highly recommended (give yourself a couple of days) and tour Horatio Nelson‚Äôs flagship, HMS Victory to really get a feel for what a British ‚ÄòMan of War‚Äô was like from the 18th century.",TRUE,24-10-2023,"Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",385534264
894,"The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder",Thrilling account of a real voyage that reads like a novel,LindaL,4,"The Wager was an English ship that set sail from England in 1740 during an imperial war with Spain. It was the mid-1700s, and navigational tools were primitive. Diseases among the seafarers spread rapidly, and I was incredulous, realizing how little they knew about curbing nutritional deficiencies such as scurvy. It seems absurd that in addition to not knowing about the necessity for vitamin C, insufficient levels of niacin were causing psychosis and night blindness resulting from lack of Vitamin A. After shipwrecking on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia, the story is as much about human nature as it is about surviving on an island and attaining its mission against the Spanish. It is fascinating to read about how they discovered new food sources and what they chose to learn and ignore from natives whose cultures had thrived in the areas where the Englishmen became castaways. If they were going to continue to survive and continue their naval mission, they had to build new boats without the technology available in their homeland, and there were myriad disagreements about how to proceed and also about which path to follow when it was time to embark on the dangerous waters again. Disharmony leads some groups to set sail in opposite directions eventually. When the survivors arrived back in England, the accounts of what happened were not in sync.The characters who are historical figures demonstrate the gamut of human emotions and an evolution of social mores. Without describing each character, I‚Äôll point out that we meet a dominating captain with poor leadership traits. And, of course, we meet argumentative underlings who have smug independence. Then, we see ferocious workers and others with inherent leadership skills and charisma. All of the men are familiar with British naval order and ranking conventions. Yet, more hierarchies develop as the men struggle to survive and create social order. As the subtitle suggests, the fight for survival leads to becoming mutinous and murderous. Grann describes the basic human drives and terrors with admirable writing skills.Writing, in the eighteenth century, was an honorable thing to do. The men onboard the Wager kept written logs‚Äîsome were required, and others were kept to document some of the mutinous decisions. David Grann had copious notes and records to use when piecing this story together. Rousseau and Voltaire cited the Wager‚Äôs expedition reports, as did Charles Darwin and Herman Melville. The seafaring journalists quote the Bible, poets, and famous writers. It is incredible how learned they were. Grann uses his well-honed investigative and research skills to weave a beautiful story of what reportedly happened and the eloquent analysis by those who experienced it. Grann‚Äôs ability to combine first-person accounts of the expedition with his summation of the events provides fabulous text about the seafarers and their exploits. Each creative, descriptive section title structures the book and shapes the voyage with metaphoric summaries: The Wooden World, Into the Storm, Castaways, Deliverance, and Judgment are the main sections, and Gran used these to develop the book so that it reads like a novel and keeps the reader riveted. I highly recommend this narrative to everyone, even those who prefer fiction to nonfiction.",TRUE,31-08-2023,"Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2023",385534264

896,"The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder",Masterful,Burns,5,"The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny, and Murder. David Grann. Doubleday, 2023. 352 pages.On January 28, 1742, a thing that could very loosely have been called a boat - more like boat-ish, washed up on the shore of Brazil. On it were about thirty barely living men who had once been part of the crew of the British ship called The Wager that had left England in 1740 as part of a small fleet off to harass the Spanish in the so-called ""War of Jenkin's Ear"" or the War of Austrian Succession. They seemed to be all that was left of a crew of a couple of hundred, and they told the story of their wreck off the southern tip of South America, their survival on the desolate landscape for months, and their incredible 3000-mile-long voyage to Brazil. But, wait, there's more! Six months later an even sadder boat washed up on the coast of Chile, with just three inhabitants, including the ship's captain, and they added a new layer to the tale: murder and mutiny. When the survivors finally arrived back home in England, having been away from their loved ones for 4 or 5 years, accusations flew back and forth, various accounts were published, and the public was enthralled by the mystery and drama of what exactly had happened to The Wager and its crew.David Grann is the author of Killers of the Flower Moon, and he has established himself as one of the top writers of narrative nonfiction working today. His follow-up to Killers doesn't disappoint. The reader will learn a lot about life on a 1740s British warship and about how the command structure within the navy operated, but Grann also succeeds in bringing the men to life and telling their stories and how they dealt with their tragedy and hardships. Some men behaved more nobly than others, of course, but all suffered.Grann also relates the story of the shipwreck and subsequent court-martial to the bigger picture: empire. This incident occurred at the time that the British empire was really in ascendancy. The British performance in the War of Austrian Succession and the possibly embarrassing public spectacle of a high-profile mutiny trial might have had a major impact on Brittania's rule over the waves, and the world. Grann explores how all these big-picture ideas intersected with the very specific fears of some of the surviving crewmen that their careers and lives were at stake.",TRUE,23-08-2023,"Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2023",385534264
